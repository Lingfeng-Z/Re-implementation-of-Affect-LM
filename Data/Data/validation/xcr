er the erm the environmental health check i think he did discuss it at fantastic length the question of our public UNK an and the savings that can be made and the judgement it came to in the end was a was a very one i think on the outlook against of what you can reasonably do erm nevertheless i do gather that erm it is no longer necessary under standing orders for erm amendments to the budget to be self financing because you can move amendments to simply increase the budget and er the amendment that i reserve i suppose it's not very much
councillor
yes well we as councillor has said be it both of these matters should be discussed at great length by
on the question of the public UNK erm i feel there's been a lot of discussion about this kind of issue and i feel that what we've got now is a good agreement erm we've got still providing a good level of service with attendance at the central i don't like referring to UNK at the time that they are most needed and i think that now i wouldn't like to see us go without that if we don't really need to
on the other issue the noise pollution again i feel quite strongly about this
i mean this authority is actually erm the only authority the council is providing a call out service at all
i think we are providing a good service here and we're meeting the needs of people erm we are providing a service on thursday friday saturday and sunday now at the times which are identified by officers as the crucial times when people actually need the service
ipswich for example was providing a full service and has now actually gone to the times that we're providing
they've actually gone from a full service back to this level because this is what they've found is what people need and obviously this is surely what we should be able to do erm i think that you know by providing the extra ten thousand my concern now is that we actually make sure that our offices are fully covered here
the spend accounted to quite dangerous situations sometimes
we've got now quite a lot of new officers who don't necessarily have the experience of dealing with the situations
they may need to go out in pairs which is why i think that we do need to put more money into the budget to provide this service and make sure that we're doing it in the best possible way erm so i mean i think that it's very important that we're consistent about this
i think that to go to a full service that is actually what's moving go back again is actually just confusing the people
i think that people need to know what we are providing so we need to be monitoring continually monitoring that this is actually at the times it's meeting people's needs and i'm sure that we will be hearing from members if it wasn't and we're not i mean it seems to me that the level of services provided now is very satisfactory and we shouldn't y'know obviously give our officers support to continue
here
councillor
right agree with what councillor and councillor have had to say about the first part of this
i think we've already discussed over great length and i think we've gone as far as we can go at this moment
on the second part well nobody feels more strongly that i do about the problems of noise pollution and i agree entirely there er with what councillor has to say but may i remind members that this council did have a full service for a six months period you all seem to have forgotten that we did have a full service an experimental one which ran for six months er we were advised by the officers at the end of that period it was not necessary to run the full seven day a week service it was not necessary we are still being advised that is not necessary that is the advice we were given at the last committee meeting and er the majority of members supported that
now i will give my UNK mr mayor that if and when the situation arises that a full service is required and needed it will get my full support er i hope it's not but if it should arise i would have no hesitation in supporting the second part of the amendment
i don't know if any of you saw very recently the UNK programme which was on television dealing with this problem in some of the london UNK and god UNK if we ever reach that stage erm because it is quite UNK so i do think that although we have a problem our problem is mainly confined to the weekend
councillor
thank you mr mayor yes just briefly erm
at the present time and in er the public fund and the health committee we did decide to have a review after so i think that is actually in control i don't think we should mess about with it any more at this point
erm on the emergency call out i getting surprised that this council insist that it's lit if we don't need it er at all service i'm sure i'm quite certain that we have never been told that there's always been a question of anything that goes to actually give us a better call out service
councillor i second it
thank you erm i'd just like to UNK slightly to start off with
i feel i must if anyone in my in my ward there are two rounds
at this moment UNK avenue and harvey UNK avenue
they put traffic calming down UNK avenue the result of this was that the traffic then moved round to harvey UNK avenue so j to avoid going over the UNK they go up harvey UNK avenue
the re the reason i bring this up the reason i bring this up you've supported that in the past you know they've said those in the you would agree with that so the reason i bring this up is that if you we start off by offering a full service across the whole week
then what happens is we say well we don't need the service of noise UNK monday tuesday UNK erm so what we'll do is we will concentrate on thursday friday saturday
now one of the things that we have in this city that i don't think they have as many in ipswich are students and that must be one of the biggest they are they party UNK of the century they have parties all the time
so
for parties they are quite a bright lot of students if we are operating thursday friday saturday and sunday they say aha there's no service monday tuesday wednesday
they start having parties on monday tuesday and wednesday
they're not too worried about getting up for work the next day
they may get up at ten or eleven
ten or eleven for lectures erm that erm i think that the is quite a strong reason well the other reason is at the weekends are we providing enough cover
is there enough cover
i was told today by well i am actually through the process at the moment where i'm acting as a witness in a case erm for noise erm so well i checked
so the environmental health officer that is dealing with that said to me that he is very stretched at weekends
people are ringing up and no i'm sorry i can't come out because i'm too busy
seven or eight calls on one night
one of the problems is that you can't say one night you may get seven or eight calls
the next night you may get two
the poor UNK having to get up at two or three o'clock in the morning this is being paid for it
i was quite surprised to see he was wide UNK and quite awake when he came to my flat
but the point is
if you're going to if you're going to provide the service you have to be careful that it is being effective as effective as it can be does it need to be more effective and should it be operating all week
i actually believe it should be operating all week and i think we should support this amendment
thank you
councillor
mr mayor i do feel after councillor er speech i just have to make a little comment erm people in my ward
but having i could just tell councillor that the main problems which he felt he had to bring into this debate the main problem is parking across the UNK in harvey UNK avenue both the residents get very fed up because the parking
i accept that there is a certain
do these cars parking across UNK have horns blowing
i do detect a certain er UNK here i would point out that it is now twenty five past nine and we still haven't this UNK business
there is a lot left to do so can we please er try and stick to the point i have to chair right to respond should he so chose but not about the cars in UNK avenue
i mean i take this more seriously my on UNK and UNK have to be cancelled now because they will be
and UNK and saturday clearly a time when they get their heads down and write their essays
now my experience of the average student of this
we got lots of evidence to suggest that actually the amount of noise problem outside weekends is actually and we don't actually have the staff to actually deal with this problem without considerably more expenditure than anybody in this council is actually talking about and our tendency towards this erm again this is a bid of what's it sounds good and as to the public UNK this has been UNK it's been negotiated about it's been looked at very UNK indeed
we've now got a good package which saves us nearly eighty thousand pounds and to actually undo all of that and create an awful lot of public UNK plus a problem with regard to potential redundancy to particular saving that UNK this as the absolutely completely UNK and except for where it came from i would be UNK if it came tonight
right can we please move forward to the vote on this item
proposed as it's been suggest by councillor
those who would wish to take it in parts please show those against taking it in parts this evening we will vote on it as one amendment in that case
those in favour of the amendment please show those against the amendment please show thank you
do i have to call the UNK
please in the absence of any further amendments we now move back to the motion and give councillors the opportunity to debate the
does have the right to stand up on his UNK legs again
no
good thank you very much
those in favour of the i did want to say something
it was very good of you to offer but er i did UNK myself i was going to i was going to talk about
those in favour of the substantive motion please show and those against and my cast
i'll give my casting UNK vote in favour of the UNK motion
right if we can now pass on to item ninety three a seven
comments no thank you very much ninety two a eight sorry ninety two ninety three a eight sorry capital resources
ninety three a eight i would like to ask a question mr mayor
the same question i asked at city hall it's slightly different in that now the council has left two and a half available over the next erm three years given that it is not already taken
we've made it clear what we would do with the money i still would like to know what the labour group plan to do with it
i have an amendment
some sense is a technical amendment in that we know that there are a whole series of schemes which we which have been
erm which it is the intent of this council to actually pursue for y'know a wide variety of reasons
in addition we clearly want to have a relatively small scale of capital fund available for a wide variety of the needs and i have identified leisure uses traffic calming environmental improvements that's the ones which i
okay we a major cause of some five hundred thousand pounds and we give addition to the three point six five one million which has been identified in this amendment
and it would be helpful for councillor i would say that i know that there are a third of our members and from the program committees for capital expenditure which i suspect is going to be to excess of the five hundred thousand pounds per year which we actually have
now that will need to be assessed by the council as a whole against it's priorities with regard to the balancing of the use of capital against capital to prop up the revenue er expenditure of the council and UNK er to deal with the problems arising er out of government er legislation and clearly we are going to have to make some decisions about this
but there is undoubtedly a need for council expenditure in this city and elsewhere in this particularly recommendation we clearly have to realise more capital whether from the UNK of our asset or of course by
it seems to me that all of us in this chamber have at one time or another wanted to actually spend money erm it comes programme of committees i don't think it's UNK upon me at the moment to UNK on what programme committees are actually er but to predict exactly where they will want their expenditure to go but i do know is that there is a huge backlog of member generated aspirations in terms of the environmental improvements traffic calming facilities UNK which i suspect were actually generated UNK in excess of the figures which we have before us tonight which is why we clearly leave open that further bids against capital can be made in the course of the next three years erm which will be assessed against the overall financial position of the council and i think the council much more than that
is there a seconder for that
thank you UNK your right the debate on please yes that's right
my guess is that by a side wind er can mix all the erm items on the list terms would include erm maybe committed and maybe not committed expenditure and that if it does affect because erm there are some items erm in the erm not clear whether it's committed or not market square er which we don't want to support
we think th a good idea erm but an UNK at this point
but i would like to clarify exactly what the effect of this amendment is on the question of erm council's policy on the items already on the list
not been debated as part of the capital programme
have a capital programme in obviously the sense that it would be difficult to get that suggest
i understand your concern an and were that the case show your UNK to go with the amendment but there is no such implication that the three point six five one million er thereby becomes committed in any sense and the big this is an additional provision which may lead er may gone up to er over and above that but it doesn't actually admit it to that
okay and i think that as long as that's
this is an this is an additional amendment it's neither it's neither specific nor UNK
cos that's what the answers in that figure are
is there any further discussion on the amendment
no councillor in that case no
no
those in favour please show those in favour of the amendment please show thank you and against none okay it's carried
i wanted to say
ninety three a nine right we now turn to the document of the housing committee ninety three g one
yes councillor
thank you mr mayor i just
any further interests no in that case councillor
thank you mr mayor erm i want to be very brief mr mayor that the debate on houses and rent increases has taken place and has been well UNK over recent weeks and i don't have any intention tonight of re debating those issues
my colleagues and i actually take no pleasure in agreeing to a rent increase which results in the highest public sector rates among our neighbouring districts er it is some eighteen percent higher than the average of eight local councils
erm the answer in our minds is to take positive steps to reduce the housing revenue account debt burden a matter which we will continue to UNK to debate until something is done about it
we intend to participate fully in the promised review of housing revenue account expenditure which is er coming later in this year
i want to address the remainder of my of my ri remarks mr mayor if i may to the liberal democrats er party
although basically
you can still address them to me
although er physically on my right i think their policies in so far as i UNK they have any er are most definitely far from the right
more than john major anyway
their housing spokesman recently mr mayor was quoted as saying that the trouble is it is very difficult to think of a solution
when there isn't one
that surely mr mayor is the very essence of politics to come up with a modern solution to today's problems
no one every said it was going to be easy
so mr mayor i would like to repeat my recent challenge to the liberal party
if you have a policy for housing or anything else for that matter how about sharing it with the rest of us right and until you come up with an alternative policy don't you start knocking us for having a policy which we are prepared to debate
thank you mr mayor
we might as well be councillor and actually sort of erm stated the problem to which it is very difficult to find a solution and that problem is how do you keep council rents below nine and a half percent that is a problem to which councillor does not have a solution
councillor UNK that er we're bringing council rents up by nine and half percent but what we're doing is in fact precisely what his government is recommending us to do so i'm a little UNK so would councillor kindly at some point explain why he UNK his own government's policy
erm take some time off to read erm the handbook we got from the housing finance seminar because clearly he doesn't understand his contacts
yes look i'm sorry we've got to raise rents by nine and a half percent
unfortunately the government is assuming that's all we are doing so they're cutting housing subsidy accordingly and we would have been left with no choice that's all there is to be said on the matter
neither have you
thank you mr mayor erm i think for a for a tory councillor er if even form the shape of er
to choose er erm the labour party er housing er strategy their housing policy is well UNK but given that this is going to be recorded perhaps not a very good idea
it UNK me it hurts me
ah
with regard to the now UNK four percent increase which then if you may made i'm sure councillors deny it and if we are to believe the reason that we have to bring our rents to this level is because government policy so UNK that we shall do
and the reason that rents in cambridge are higher than in those in surrounding areas or the eight that the councillor is talking about is because the rent levels which er the government require us to raise to are historically based on right to buy values and as he knows as well as i do house prices in cambridge have been relatively consistently higher than they have in surrounding areas
our rent levels have always been in line in the case of tenants guidelines and i of course there were savings that about is insufficient in areas
erm in we were not sitting here at the end of our how many years is it now thirteen fourteen years
er of tory council and policy perhaps we would not have to be saying to our tenants that we must raise you rents by nine point four percent this year and let's not forget seventeen nine i think seventeen point six percent last year that were government guidelines
this is tory policy
thank you
is there any further debate on ninety three two one
right in that case can we do it to ninety three t twenty
erm yes under standing order thirteen and permission of the council erm i do call upon the chair as he introduced this item do i have your consent so to do
yes thank you very much
councillor
thank you er mr mayor erm i knew we would get to that part of the agenda where
i just want to briefly introduce this i don't want to speak in any great we have had a long debate in house do you if you wish to engage in a long debate again in view of the time tonight
the reason that this has been brought on the reason that this er agenda item brought to housing committee was basically er because it was there and er it's i think it's UNK to bring forward to housing committee any er government regulations or we need to look at debating and er and that's basically the reason
erm i think i'll leave it at that for this moment in time and er if i may speak at the end
you'll have the right to
erm any further
yes mr mayor i have an amendment mr mayor
the amendment is very simple members will have read it already before it gets UNK on the wall
it is the alternative recommendation that we put forward to housing committee last week
erm now councillor and i asked for this matter to be brought to this chamber because erm we felt that the matter w was important enough that all members of this council should have an opportunity to debate it
the background of the subject is as far as i can work out that the council main approaches to two housing associations with a view to obtaining their erm ideas on how a scheme to transfer void properties to the housing associations would work
this erm approach would have enabled the council to obtain some capital receipts under the terms of the chancellor's autumn statement
the report that was put to committee by the officers have arguments which i feel are UNK and at best UNK
ooh
it puts forward a UNK long term disadvantages as reasons why we should ignore the short term benefits offered to us up to the end of this calendar year
the another point is that having raised the hopes of the housing associations the council is now actually trying to close a door that we ourselves opened and this is UNK to paying lip service to the health and the housing associations yes we'll support you but not if it means that we have to sell you our houses
er the housing associations approached both have better records than us for rent collection and better records on void times
that is to say that no matter how much we are improving our performance the associations have already beaten us to it and that mr mayor i would suggest is a very good case for transferring all our stock to housing associations and there is one final point i would like to make mr mayor
mr mayor in a recent conversation with the minister of housing
ooh
i was informed i was informed mr mayor that even labour controlled leicester and labour controlled sheffield have at last seen the wisdom of making capital receipts from UNK er council house sales
these councils have found that they have more cash available with which to repair maintain and improve their remaining stock and that is a lesson which we in cambridge will be well advised to listen
i ask this council to ignore the recommendation from the housing committee and to support me in passing this amendment
thank you
thank you
is there a seconder for the amendment
who was it that mentioned UNK dum and UNK
councillor please
oh dear
erm well first i mean i'm sorry to hear you're keeping some bad company stephen bad news
where to begin
i think the that the first thing to say is that one of the reason why this option this paper was asked for was that we so we could actually begin to look to see whether or not UNK transfer made sense in cambridge
now you can't do that without going and asking think with the organisations such as housing associations some factor information about where we would stand if we decide to go down that route
so we're not raising their expectations that this is going to go ahead that this is the committee policy of this council
we're just asking if we chose to do this what would happen from your point of view
what would be the consequences of it
i mean you can't actually examine the options without asking the question so i mean i just think that's a rather foolish point to introduce into a into the debate there
housing association is time to rent arrears
now come on stephen you were at the same debate that i was at the housing committee
now we know some of the reasons behind the time situation
councillor our void times are very good in terms of the UNK
now there are certain measures which housing associations enter into which we don't and for good reasons which enable then to have perhaps in on occasions to have slightly lower UNK times okay
now we went through that
one of them was the fact that housing associations ask for the keys is or ask for UNK up to a month in advance of the fact that someone's going to leave and that is not something which in terms of our stock we find practical to do
so we've been through quite a lot of those and it's it the case doesn't really stack up
again we're back to the same arguments on the capital receipt and i don't intend to begin re UNK those but quite frankly i mean i wouldn't claim by any to have a vast or a slightly deeper knowledge of housing finance but obviously since you've been on the council the same length of time as i have i mean you've got even less
ooh
councillor
yes well as in the c mr mayor as in the case of the active promotion of right to buy nonsense
the argument in favour of er UNK transfer is fundamentally weak because we can't trust the government not to take the money away from us
the argument against UNK transfer is that it makes a nonsense of rational housing management
what we ought to be aiming for is more UNK estate management
we should be more efficient and we should be more responsive to the needs of tenants
now UNK transfer will do exactly the opposite
you'll what you'll end up with is different organisations managing houses scattered all over the city
this will lead to higher management costs per household
it means it it's going to be inefficient it's going to be less responsive to UNK needs
now i'm sure the minister councillor would like us to be more efficient and he would like us to be more responsive to tenants needs so let's do what the minister ask would like us to do and vote against this conservative amendment
yes cou councillor is second
yes councillor
i think it's just words that briefly talking about that issue office states because i think in terms of management it just does not make any sense
i mean it doesn't make sent i i'm just saying what is saying there
i mean yes of course we should live UNK together er who would y'know sector of those people who have taken advantage of the right to buy and so on and so forth but we talking about housing management in about housing management costs and if you have an estate of y'know being repaired similar houses which a lot of our estates are it makes sense that they're managed as it were centrally er and because that's the most efficient way of doing it erm if you have a variety of different landlords in er one estate or one street and all the houses are similar when it comes to things like UNK and so forth it it's UNK a great deal of er of work and it is not cost efficient and it doesn't make any common sense at all
erm and therefore i g i do think that is quite a big issue as far as this but all i these all these arguments have been UNK as we've said before in housing committee but i would just like to make one point and this is it
i strongly believe as i'm sure all my group do and i think perhaps many of erm opposition in local authority housing function
i believe that local authorities should have a strong housing function that we as local authorities should be providing good well managed social housing in which our tenants have a say where we have good tenant participation where we have tenants taking a part in the sorts of repairs that they want to see where every year they are er consulted and asked about where they want us to go next in terms of UNK and repair
i think that is fundamental to a local authority i think it is something that we have here in cambridge it is a centre of excellence for local authority housing
there may be things that we can improve and i'm damn sure there are and we work hard at
right can i see those in favour of the amendment please show
it is your amendment
and all those against please show thank you very much
now call upon members oral questions to put their question out on the sheet circulated the order is determined by the drawing names at random out of a box in the parlour before this meeting
the fact that mine came nine has absolutely nothing to do with it
you are reminded that members are limited to two minutes in asking their questions
chairs similarly limited to two minutes in their reply
the question a to ask a supplementary question referring to the previous answer and that chair must have two minutes to reply to that
councillor
thank you mr mayor
councillor perhaps you could erm tell us the cost both spent and anticipated of writing this rather erm new electoral role leaflet that might be coming out if we feel like it
fo for i would like to talk at length about my new electoral role
erm we have always out any er leaflet erm clearly so that people to put their names on the register erm that is a statutory responsibility erm the expenditure in excess of what we had er done in the past is actually going to be a very small amount of one officer's time in UNK the leaflet erm otherwise the expenditure will remain as it as it always has for all UNK and purposes and i think that answers your question if clearly you have problems about getting people on the electoral register that means there's something about your own electoral
yes councillor
i have no problem at all with that councillor
what i would say is i just wonder what the point of it is ed on the principal of why fix something if it ain't broke wouldn't it be better to perhaps spend officer's time elsewhere rather than fashion designs of three colour printing on new leaflets
erm all councillors have been circulated with this
i've clearly feel that you probably responded by saying that the old one which is led to under registration was perfectly adequate for your needs which as i said says something about your view of the electoral process
this i think is actually more likely to get people to register to vote i think regardless of any party affiliation you all have something to benefit from that and i suspect the vast majority of members of the council will see that any well designed leaflet that gets people to put themselves on the register is to the benefit of democracy
here
councillor
thank you mr mayor er there is in cherry UNK er a new residents association on the road UNK road estate
they have identified a number of problem areas which raise some environmental problems to very definite housing problems
we now have in place a new estates officer for cherry UNK er can i ask that there is a special report brought to the housing committee er before the summer UNK on the possible solutions to the problems that have been identified
er thank you er councillor erm i would actually welcome the er the new residents association which the area
i think it's er i think it covers the largest area for any er one association and er y'know it's g very pleased about that erm i am aware of your er meeting and i think it it's obvious that all new residents association will identify erm a lot of things which need doing er when they're first formed
and i think they're actually picking out a particular area for a report is not necessarily good practice erm i think we can identify er those areas piece by piece we will go through them they can be brought forward to a variety of areas
i must prepare to say at this point that i have a special report on the UNK road area to er committee not just on the now but i think we probably need to have further consultation with regard to the needs in that area
that has been quite a lot of money er spent in that area and which i'm quite happy to talk to you about erm i don't need
i'll leave it at that
thank you councillor
no i have no supplementary i'm perfectly satisfied with the reply er thank you
councillor
thank you mr mayor
i think we all recognise that traffic issues here in cambridge are likely to be controversial issues and i think we'd all equally recognise that er the joint traffic management sub committee has made considerable progress in recent years in the provision of cycle lanes for example in dealing with illegal parking er on the UNK road and in improving the environment for UNK in our main shopping streets
now one member of the joint traffic management sub committee who has been closely associated with all of these three issues is county councillor tony and i must say mr mayor that i am surprised to say the least by the way in which councillor appears to have been treated by some members of the labour party in this city
i propose that honourable members of this council er would not wish to be associated with such a disgraceful campaign to UNK councillor even if he does have strongly held views and i would like to give councillor as chairman of the environment committee this opportunity to set the record straight on that point
can i just clarify whether you've asked a question
i'm giving the chair the opportunity to erm er set the record straight on that point that's my question
right well i've been waiting since er what is it twelve o'clock this morning what on earth this question can be and i certainly didn't er come up with this possible erm all i can say is that i have always got on extremely well with tony and
good
do you wish to ask a supplementary question
councillor to the councillor
erm well my question about the break in at the UNK flats UNK erm in the UNK the facilities are controlled by a UNK machine built into the wall
to collect the UNK er from the UNK machine you have to go through the adjacent community room into a small box room at the far end
in that small box room you can gain access to the rear of the er UNK machine
about three weeks ago well let me just the money actually falls into a tray at the bottom of the UNK machine which literally slides in and out it's a very quick method and c could
councillor could i just perhaps request that you perhaps don't make it quite so easy for any future break ins
i'll explain have you got your notes with you from last week
what's the last heading we got to
i know we've erm i shall prevent myself UNK basically the UNK sorry
well that's what we did
oh brilliant right
just trying to sort this out
yeah it's for some er it's for somebody to get a general idea of the kind of things that happen in lectures
it's what they say it's just the whole business of looking at lectures for the british national corpus
the whole department's supposed to be involved and i keep forgetting to do it possibly deliberately
sorry thing is just UNK up
okay then ladies and gentlemen hello good evening and er something yes
right various bits of information for you
erm first of all i did promise to you that i'd give you some idea of the sort of material would be on next week's erm multiple guess questions okay
so perhaps i'll just run through some of those
erm can i ask you please to point out to anybody who isn't here which i guess is quite a number of people there's probably six or seven people who're not here er that the test is in fact next tuesday that's february the twenty second is it
okay and you're asked to be erm in the UNK sorry in the er great hall at five o'clock if you possibly can okay
the session will take an hour
my guess is you may not need the hour to complete the er course work but er it's always difficult to say when you set the thing yeah
er it's partly using some questions UNK been around for a very long time but there're some subtle variations and some new ones added in okay
so they look a little bit different
if you've got a past paper it won't do an awful lot of good
erm the idea of course is you haven't got past papers an er under no circumstances leave the exam hall with the paper okay
please leave it on the table
what else to say about it
basically you're gonna get erm some questions on motivation
i can't quantify these i can't tell you how many there'll be but there will be questions on motivation but before that there'll be some questions on the basics of kind of y'know studying work psychology the sort of thing you'll find in an introductory chapter er not only of the arnold book but in other books as well
erm there's going to be a number of questions on the ho of er selection and testing including stuff on UNK and validity
so that was the sort of stuff that did for you for a couple of weeks before christmas
okay so that's selection testing UNK validity
erm there'll be material on impression formation and UNK which of course a number of the did an essay on person perception yes
personal perception
is that a more familiar heading
okay
there'll be something on job satisfaction a number of questions on job satisfaction
and er there'll be a number of questions on stress and a number of questions on leadership
and when i last looked at it one question on behaviour modification had managed to creep on there as well but i can't remember what the question is so you'd better pay attention for the whole of the rest of this lecture in case i in case i remember it
okay right erm okay what else
yes erm for the final year students your er assignment
er the majority but only just the majority of your assignments are complete and they are in six one eight to be picked up
rather unfortunate because er of course you d i can't tell you which ones i've done which ones i haven't done but all assignments will be back in six one eight final year assignments will be back in six one eight erm at some point early on friday morning
okay so i've got thirty four remaining ones to mark and i've got er all day tomorrow to do that and some on thursday and possibly some time tonight
so i'm hopeful that i will UNK well i'm certain that i will complete UNK accidents the marking of final year assignments
so you'll be able to pick those up from six one eight on erm um on friday morning okay
so if you kind of er hang ar hang about til ten o'clock they should be there by ten
and er generally i'm sort of very impressed with the standard of work on the essays so okay
right thanks very much for doing the erm the questionnaire last week okay
you'll be you'll probably be interested in the results
i certainly was okay won't stretch that far you see okay well basically you all felt appalling about tutorials and er yes
how many all together
erm there are between sixty and seventy i think it's probably nearer the sixty end i keep taking them out rather than adding them in okay you'll be pleased to know
i d i don't think you'll find it a strain to do in an hour
i think you'll find at a minute a question you'll b you're okay really
group dynamics
nothing on group dynamics no
i've eliminated the group dynamics ones
okay
actually it's a good point because there will be er i will g be giving you different guidance obviously about the final exam where material which we haven't covered er we a examined here may well be examined yeah
but a you've only had twenty minutes on group dynamics
i didn't really feel that there was very much there that i could i could ask you about at this stage okay
right erm okay so tutorials then
well erm basically the this the tutorials run by all run their course
i i've a feeling that er she may be seeing individual students this friday er and that's all so er i don't think there will be a tutorial
erm but there will be a new set of tutorials provided for you because i think there's a general recognition that you've been very badly treated indeed er as regards this erm and they're likely to be run by me in term three okay
now i'm not able to do tutorials for you this term at the times that you're available cos they clash with lectures that i do er for another course
so er the idea is that there will be tutorials provided in term three and i'll be giving you details a published programme of those as well okay
so there will be some tutorials
i know that many of you feel you've had almost nothing of value from the current tutorials and er erm which is rather unfortunate
in terms of lectures there was a fairly normal distribution
that is that most of you felt they're okay some of you felt they were quite good and some of you felt they were quite bad
they distributed normally quite well
erm some specific points that came up in the comments that you made
er firstly that i'm too fast and er a number of people have said this to me so er and it's true so i don't wish to elaborate further on that
however i do respond well to requests to slow down so
from all courses so do erm make sort of gestures or something
erm but okay
the point a lot of you made was that the course does seem to be very based on one text the arnold text and you're quite well you're almost right about that
ha about half of you thought that was a good thing and about half of you thought it was a bad thing
erm th the general idea is that i'm actually responding to a request from last years' student group so that the previous lecturer did pass on to me that the student group had been unhappy that there were too many UNK referred to as they couldn't necessarily get them from the library and they couldn't afford to buy more than one text
so it was UNK in a sort of staff student consultative group last year so i have been requested to UNK it in some measure to a single text
erm having said that i've not always done that
so for example the lecture i'm going to give you today isn't reflected at all in arnold erm so er i think it'd be helpful if i were to give you some indication of when there were and when there weren't
erm but er i can appreciate obviously for you particularly final year students to have s y'know a single text which not all of you are not that keen on but er some of you do see it as an advantage as well
erm um what else
yeah
the other thing which a lot of you asked for was more handouts and more overhead UNK slides
erm i i've had a couple of difficulties with those
er one is actually getting the o h p's so that you can see them at the back
it's actually quite a deep lecture theatre i think it's probably the biggest the university UNK outside the great hall and er it it's difficult to get them large enough so that everyone can see at the back
one option might be that i'll produce some slides
there's a slide UNK at the back of the hall which i can control from the front so i may be aiming to get some slides for you instead of the overhead UNK
the other difficulty with handouts is there's an awful lot of you g to give the handouts to so we tend to waste a lot of time
er but again y'know i could in theory provide some handouts for you which you could perhaps pick up at the end of the er of the lecture from the front or even have available in a general office for you okay
so i do take note of those and i'll see what i can do about those okay
erm having said that i think UNK tend to accumulate these things over time and this is the first year i've run this course so i don't have a great stock of things i can i can show you
right oh yes what else
erm if he's here could i see him afterwards about his request for er a questionnaire
okay so where we got to last week then was looking at the analysis and modification of er work behaviour
so if we can erm take that a bit further
i think the last the last heading you got well you put a heading down before we finished and that was UNK behaviour and modification
is that true
yes it is
good
okay
well i think the er other point i was making last week was that erm this whole are of learning theory is erm y'know a very traditional area
bye
was it something i said already
erm this whole area of learning theory is a very traditional area but it has it has been very influential actually very recently despite being very ancient
it's been influential very recently in clinical psychology and also in work psychology
erm so erm what we've got then is the idea of ah looking at some kind of UNK analysis although i'll got into UNK analysis in just a few minutes
and also er looking at the kind of rewards that erm an employee might benefit
if you're going to use this by UNK specific desired behaviour you need to have a look at a reward list and there's a whole range of potential rewards UNK been around
simple feedback itself feedback of performance can be a powerful sort of reward okay
but other people have used things like tokens which can be y'know saved up to exchanged for consumer UNK for example
so er if you y'know do the desired behaviour you collect so many UNK and er y'know when you've got ten UNK you exchange it for a television or something like that but there's a whole range of things of that nature
erm okay let's have a look briefly at the idea of a token economy
now this is something more from clinical use but again has potential uses in work psychology
but the notion of a token economy is that you reward desired behaviour at the point at which the behaviour is performed okay
and there's a lot of evidence which suggests that immediate reward is much more effective than delayed reward okay
so it's important to reward at the point of the desired behaviour okay
so for example pay schemes whereby pr productivity is UNK once a year would seem to not y'know deal with that very effectively
okay so ha if you're going to reward at the point of actually doing the desired behaviour you've got a problem because people er you may not be able to give them something appropriate at that time which is UNK
the standard example comes from working with children
the child has behaved itself and you want to reward the child then you er you give them some kind of er a chocolate bar or something or a handful of UNK or something
erm the difficulty is that you can't really do that in work situations
people may be motivated by bigger rewards
so the idea is you have some kind of token so that er classic example in sort of junior schools primary schools that y'know if a child actually does what you want it to do it gets a kind of star in a star chart and added up so many stars it gets some kind of present and basically the same kind of thing can be applied in clinical and in occupational UNK as well
so you're able to reward people ah with some kind of appropriate er some kind of token a star or whatever it happens to be some kind of token which it can then hav has a monetary value okay
er and in theory terms primary UNK are something which meets biological needs like food is a primary UNK okay
er however people are y'know are also reinforced by things which have no direct value
like we are reinforced heavily by money
money has no direct value it has an exchange value
so the idea of tokens exchange value so they're rather like money
er another idea is which i think is can be useful here particularly in comes to focusing problems and difficulties at work is the idea of a UNK analysis okay
now a UNK analysis or perhaps another way of looking at this is a decision analysis is quite interesting
the sort of thing you might do was if you've got a decision is you might want to look t at the of that decision okay
so you might want to look at erm er somebody's thoughts feelings something about the situation okay
so you've got you've got things which set up or stimulate the behaviour or the decision
we can call that okay
and we can have a look at some consequences of that so you could have short term long term consequences
you can break it down further you can add in things here about what somebody wanted okay what somebody was trying to get hold of what they wanted and also perhaps what they wanted to avoid
so let's add a couple more columns in and then back here you can have a look at whether they actually gain those whether they got what they wanted
then you can start looking at er at alternatives okay and what you end up with is a is a way of UNK er a decision or a choice to behave in a certain way okay
so you can look at ah a whole lot of things like this
i'm used to d using this kind of material in relation to people's decisions about UNK
er so if you look at their smoking erm people can fill in a kind of smoking chart in which you look at that
or again at drinking behaviour
if somebody goes on a drinking UNK that's the behaviour the decision they make
what is going on that led up to that
what's the factors in y'know involved in that decision that behaviour
what're the consequences of that okay
so you've got a way of UNK behaviour and what that leads you into is the ability to UNK the consequences of certain behaviour okay
a lot of UNK work is about UNK the consequences okay
so that er you can give somebody short term benefits and long term benefits for behaving differently okay
you can identify alternative decisions alternative UNK look at the consequences of those
you can also UNK the outer feelings of the behaviour as well
okay so you've got an a kind of an analysis tool which will then enable you to look at how you may seek to modify behaviour
okay
let's have a look at a practical example now
let's have a look at a sample study
okay and nineteen eight one
erm they investigated the use of ear defenders in a high noise textile factory okay
so the company had supplied ear defenders they wanted their work force to use those ear defenders erm but in fact there was very little use of them
so the noise level in the factory was sufficient to be a threat to the er the hearing of their employees
the company had a responsibility to avoid that
er but ear defender use is only thirty five percent which is fairly UNK
okay so what they did was they looked at what would be an attractive UNK in their work force erm if they were to persuade them to wear ear defenders and they found out from doing research in the work force that consumer UNK would be appropriate
that's what the work force would like as rewards for the desired behaviour was consumer UNK
okay so they got the base line measurement thirty five percent people use them then they went to a variable ratio er token economy system
do you remember we talked about schedules of UNK last week
yes
that you get one to one UNK
the UNK in the box UNK a lever gets an item of food
but if we make the reward of the item of food erm not UNK okay so it comes at variable intervals er then the UNK actually works harder pressing the lever it's more likely to do the behaviour and it's less likely to give up doing that behaviour afterwards okay
so we know that a variable ratio UNK is likely to UNK the production of behaviour and erm also UNK the chance of that behaviour being given up immediately UNK is withdrawn
so there's theoretical grounds for suggesting that a variable er variable interval erm did i say a variable interval or variable ratio
i've got variable ratio down here token economy system would be used
now what this meant in practice was that er y'know appropriate supervisors would appear at random intervals and give people tokens if they were wearing ear defenders okay
but not all the time okay
so a supervisor appears at random on some occasions they get tokens some occasions they don't
so any time a supervisor appears which could be any time you might get a token okay
now the tokens are actually worth quite a lot in terms of consumer UNK
it's a bit like the sort of green shield stamps idea or UNK petrol stations whatever it is yes
if you're wearing the ear defenders when the supervisor comes round and happens to be on the token UNK out tour and you're wearing them you get your token okay
collect so many tokens you get a t v or a washing machine or whatever it is that you want
you save up for the tokens to get what get y'know whatever it is you're after
okay that led to an immediate rise in the use of ear defenders to ninety percent okay
so it went right up to ninety percent straight away
er the study actually lasted two months but the er the behaviour continued at ninety p at ninety percent for nine months' follow up
so highly effective and no drop off there
another example i won't give it in the same detail
similar sort of principle erm and you give er you give people lottery tickets if they turn up on time
tried to increase er erm well reduce UNK at work make sure people turn up on time you have somebody UNK out lottery tickets to people who get there by nine o'clock something like that okay
similar sort of basis
okay well there's more technical detail i could go into but i think y'know i'm not sure how useful it is to you
there's also more recent studies that you can look at as well apart from that sample one i've given you
erm but i think you will find that well covered in UNK book
i know i did in some detail particularly in the theory elements which isn't in UNK book but er i think you'll find that well covered there
okay any questions arising from that so far
behaviour the whole learning theory of behaviour and all that stuff at work
jolly good
okay well let's go on to the next topic i'm proposing to cover and that's communication in organisations
okay you may be wondering why i'm UNK up with not one but two UNK today
th there is erm a study going on to do with something called the british national corpus which i don't quite know what that's about but they want er samples of the sort of things that UNK do in lecture theatres
erm so i'm not quite sure how representative i am but er i think they do this every forty years or something and then they kind of analyse the sort of speech content that sort of stuff
so they're just after a kind of random sample of aston UNK and as the official random sample keep forgetting to put the er put the tape in the machine or turn it on or whatever it's handed on to me so i'm now UNK up to an extraordinary degree
anyway communication organisations
first of all i suggest to you that communication ar is an absolutely key process
at a common sense level you could argue it's not possible to have er any kind of relationship without communications so communication equals relationship equals communication common sense idea
y'know one way you can look at this as a social glue another expression value
so you can look at er communication as relating to overall competence and perhaps at a stronger level than that you could argue that erm communication determines not only the structure but also the strength and the scope of an organisation okay
so communication very essential if you like it determines the structure the strength and the scope of an organisation
okay now by the way you find this material actually covered in arnold at all
there's nothing in arnold on communication so for those of you who particularly want me to stay with arnold sorry this time round
erm but you will find quite a lot of relevant material in and or alternatively and depending on which edition you've got and elsewhere also
okay let's have a look at the basic idea of communication
basically what we're talking about is
okay so that's the kind of basic idea
okay in terms of communication
if you've got an idea or a message to send it has to be UNK in some way then there's various UNK or media by which it can be UNK but it's got to be UNK by the receiver for the idea or message to be understood and there's some kind of feedback mechanism potentially from the receiver to the UNK
and we should bear in mind that there's potential noise okay affecting many parts of this
okay well let's have a look at different forms of communication
i think we can start of on this at this heading of er forms of communication
have you all got that down by the way
do you want to do you want me to shut up while you write that down
yes you do really don't you
i shall just look UNK for a couple of minutes
right so forms of communication then a sub heading
different forms well let's concentrate on two oral communication written communication
okay well i think oral communication is mostly two way that's one distinction we can make
written communication mostly one way
let let's relate this to organisation
do you go and tell somebody about something or do you write them a memo
okay so the memo version is pretty well one way people write UNK back but it it's a kind of one way communication if you give somebody some information in a memo okay
should you be writing
should you be speaking to them personally
well research suggests that something like eighty eight percent that's research by UNK and bass UNK and bass nineteen eighty eight actually i may have got that date wrong so i'm not sure you should quote the date anyway it's UNK and bass
eighty three percent of communication in a in a sample organisation was face to face rather than with UNK
the general preference was that if the message or the information was ambiguous it was preferable to use oral forms of communication
so if it's an ambiguous message go and tell somebody about it so it can be clarified
on the other hand if it was quite clear and UNK then a written form was preferred okay now a study by daft et al daft as in y'know one marble short of a whatever yeah or okay er daft et al nineteen eighty seven had a look at UNK use of er of these two different media and found that in general most managers were media sensitive
what they meant by that was that managers would do the kind of thing i've just described like y'know UNK an ambiguous message UNK rather than in a memo and UNK versa
however there was a y'know significant minority who were not media sensitive who seemed to send out messages pretty well at random erm they'd use whatever medium they happened to think of at the t off the UNK of the moment rather than actually relating the medium to the message if you like
and er what they found was that the media sensitive managers were much more likely to be regarded as highly successful and sensitivity in selection of media by relating the medium to the message would seem to relate quite closely to erm y'know high performance as a manager let's have a look at
non verbal behaviour
there's a number of fairly obvious things here
perhaps the most obvious one is to do with dress like how do you dress at a at a job interview how do you dress in a particular sort of er function at work
there's certainly amongst managers certainly amongst male managers that there is an assumption that people wear suits isn't there
so you hear sometimes hear in an organisation when a manager approaches like here come the suits the er
it's very interesting working in a university what is appropriate for university UNK to wear
certainly er the higher up the kind of er organisation at a university the tendency is to is to wear different things
o much more complex perhaps for women as well more choices there
nothing very radical to tell you about that just to sort of mention it
issues about time are quite interesting also
er if you look at status and length of time you get kept waiting then the length of time you get kept waiting reflects the status differential between you and the person you're waiting on okay
we've all had to wait for doctors and UNK yeah
this is cos they tend to be high status professionals who's time is relatively precious so that you can go to the extent of actually having waiting rooms that you can be kept hanging around in
erm if you look at organisations then if you if you go and er visit somebody of low status you tend not to be kept waiting very long at all
erm medium status it may go up to more like five minutes very high status it may be approaching ten minutes okay
so there is a relationship there
yeah
yes you're absolutely right
it's to do with the difference if you like
given let let's say y'know somebody of a status goes to see somebody of equivalent status wait so it's about the distance yeah
okay
erm and it's quite interesting to look at that
what else
there's something else about use of space as well
certainly within universities the more senior the member of staff the more likely they are apparently to use a desk as a barrier erm so that they sort of er y'know you see them from behind a desk when you're at the front of the desk and they're behind the desk
erm if you look at er at a standard sort of table look at a standard sort of UNK table y'know person sitting here relative to ones sitting there tends to be of higher status
indeed if you've got groups with no status UNK between them the person who by chance lands up sitting there tends to end up behaving as a leader okay
so there's a relationship between space status and leadership there
erm you can a even look at er look at erm this sort of er non verbal messages about organisations in terms of architecture
that's an interesting one
erm not very relevant to your course unfortunately but very interesting stuff
if you're at all interested in that area then i have got you a reference i can give you to hand but it's but a great deal of er architecture certainly the thirties forties fifties reflected corporate status corporate identity
erm if you look at er the kind of erm soviet er architecture of the thirties and you can relate that quite nicely to a kind of american corporate architecture in the fifties designed to project certain sort of things
erm i there's y'know construct architecture as any other form of er communication that must be quite an interesting thing to do
how about perhaps at this point having a look at non verbal behaviour perhaps more broadly
i'm gonna suggest to you that er if w if we're going to think about channels of communication then we could UNK divide up inter personal communication to three broad sets of channels so it will be familiar to some students already i think er but not certainly not to many second years
i hope not anyway
erm very broadly we can distinguish between verbal communication yes the words we choose to use inter personally okay verbal communication
no i i'd suggest perhaps a couple of categories of non verbal communication
er a category you could call UNK and a category we could call body language perhaps okay
so what i want to suggest is that the second two categories i've mentioned that's the UNK channel and the body language channel can actually be very important in communication
what i'd like you to do now is er just for a couple of minutes informally with the people sitting next to you see if you can list as many channels as you can under those second two headings okay
i don't want you to tell me about the messages that those channel give okay
let me give you an example to start with
erm under body language you mi there might be a category of er channels around the theme of gesture okay
now one or two gestures have very specific meanings as
perhaps you're aware okay
i'm not interested in you telling me what those meaning are or coming out with kind of y'know ideas that crossing your arms means that you're defensive or anything like that
i'm interested in the channels themselves okay
so i'm interested in non verbal channels in terms of body language y'know what do you do with your body that's UNK
and non verbal channels in terms of voice okay
what is there about the voice UNK channels that're not to do with the actual words spoken
two minutes then
okay then erm i guess that's your couple of minutes up
erm i hope you've lots of interesting ideas
let's go for the for the sort of erm the UNK bit first
what kind of channels have you come up with in terms of UNK communication
yeah UNK tone okay
very critical one UNK of tone
what else
volume right speed tone so you've got tone volume speed
what else
clarity yes mhm okay go for that i'm not UNK i mean you can
what else
what about what about issues around UNK
okay to do with UNK for example
you can have you can have stuff to do with UNK
c can you spot when a speaker is nervous
as students in a lecture you can tell when a lecturer is nervous
okay because they UNK over their words they mistakes yes okay
so things about UNK
you can it's fairly easy to distinguish between somebody who's not very UNK because there's something technically very difficult about the topic and they can't actually explain it and er and somebody who's actually very nervous so you get different kinds of er speech errors UNK and speech errors
anything else there
because i t i go for verbal as the actual choice of words okay
so can you imagine if you had a conversation with somebody from er another country and you had no language in common at all
you would still ha be able to have some kind of interaction but it wouldn't actually be verbal because there would be no words in common okay
if i give you an example
erm if you may not have had to do this you may have to in the future
if you've got a UNK with you a two year old and this UNK is sort of er y'know you're looking in the shop window and this UNK sort of thirty yards away and about to walk in front of a bus okay
then it doesn't matter so much what you say that stops it walking in front of the bus it's actually how you say it
does that make sense
a and think of think of anybody here got dogs
or familiar with dogs
yeah
you c it's not what you say to the dog it's how you say it y'know
it's er it's like y'know if your UNK called rover it's if you want get it to pay attention it's the way you say rover or b m w or
erm okay so UNK is about the w is about how you use your voice
let's go on to the second category the er the body language bit
who's got who's got some headings that some UNK under body language
any suggestions
UNK
UNK thank you
facial expression
facial expression very critical one
facial expression yeah
stance
stance yeah
i think stance is a kind of sub category of UNK
UNK perhaps sitting stance something else yeah
well we've got gesture
yeah gesture right what else
you must have thought of some more than that
what about issues about personal space
social distance yeah
okay you'll find there're big er cultural differences there
okay we're a non in the u k as a culture we don't stand very close to people but actually women stand a lot closer to women than women to men or men to men
erm touch
it's a form of communication
erm UNK an interesting one
smell tends doesn't seem to be that relevant
i think i think er these days people take er take baths and showers quite often and you have to be pretty close to somebody before you smell them i guess i mean i hope you do anyway
yeah it's interesting that
it used to be much more important
er apparently there's a story about UNK and not tonight UNK stuff
i the way i s i think i think was it UNK he was married to then she would er she would object very strongly if he had a bath before they went to bed together
she liked him to smell really strongly so people have very personal UNK
you know if you're very attached to somebody you're very attached to the smell of them
er yeah
okay y it's true
okay what else
what else have you got er under that under the body language
eye contact
eye contact direction of UNK that sort of stuff
okay now is that sort of stuff important do you reckon
is it is it important
yeah okay
just to kind of get a feel of that importance erm let's think about some categories of communication which we may not use verbal channels for very much okay
two or three categories here
first category i suggest is about attitude in the sense of liking UNK
we don't tend to go up to people and say i like you okay
very much okay
imagine yourself in a night club
d do you go to night clubs
UNK okay suppose you're at a night club and suppose that you really like somebody you've been dancing with
how do you communicate to them that you really like them
do you go up to them and say i like you
it could be an interesting approach but i mean what do you do
i mean do you er stand nearer them
look at them more
find excuses to brush against them
touch yeah
okay it's all done non verbally yeah
and suppose that you've been dancing with somebody and you really don't like them at all
how d'you c how d'you persuade them to go away
well qu alright okay
so i think a stuff about attitude liking UNK
the second category would be emotion
i d very often we don't label our emotions verbally
we communicate how we feel non verbally okay
and the third the third category would be er would be that punctuation we use non verbal communication to UNK er verbal UNK
y'know if you wanna have a go you wanna say something then you make quite subtle gestures to catch the eye of somebody and so on
so we UNK this stuff
so i'm gonna suggest that extremely important for these categories of communication maybe less important if you're dealing with er purely technical UNK purely technical conversations
erm but if you're dealing with issues about human relationship then they're very important very powerful and er they can make a huge difference UNK sensitivity in the use of this kind of can be very important okay we'll come back to that cos i w when we come when we're actually looking at improving communication we'll come back to those issues
okay let's have another heading
let's have a look at major influences er on communication in organisations
i think it w basically an UNK structure is important
like y'know we we've mentioned UNK structure i think in the very first lecture er that idea the idea that you've got a kind of box at the top labelled president and you've got two boxes underneath labelled vice president and you've got y'know one box goes off to sales manager y'know the sort of thing i mean okay
so the shape of those things can be very important and if we're going to look at those y'know look at communication within an UNK structure we can think about communication that goes up from the bottom of the UNK structure to the top we can look at communication that goes down from the top of the organisation downwards and we can look at communication that goes across okay
so three ways in which communications may flow okay
and the communications in fact will be of a quite a different nature in each of those categories
so if you have a look at the idea of communication flowing down from the top of the structure lower down then w what's that communication going to be including
well i'd suggest it includes for example instructions erm directions or perhaps more UNK orders
okay so directions instructions orders flowing down from the top of the structure to the bottom of the structure and perhaps also some feedback as well
okay so we're looking at a flow of communication from the top of the structure to the bottom of the structure orders directions instructions feedback
interesting point here is are these orders directions instructions whatever are they accurately perceived towards the bottom of the hierarchy okay
so there's a very interesting study by a person who's name i'm going to write on the board okay so or et al nineteen ninety
okay what th what er this research looked at was the accuracy of perception of communication
now clearly there's a distinction to be drawn oral communication and written communication but they were doing this generally
y'know at this point not necessarily to UNK distinguish between oral and written communication
what they found was there was actually sometimes substantial differences between what the managers thought they had UNK and what the UNK thought they'd received okay
so there's a potential gap a potential meaning gap there
what's been said what's been heard
okay now obviously the greater the number of channels things go through the greater potential for the confusion okay
so there's classic sort of stories about organisation where the er president of the organisation asks somebody to investigate something and that gets translated by the vice president into sort of rather more hostile sort of thing and basically it ends up with somebody at the bottom of the pile having their UNK kicked or whatever because it's been translated or mis translated down okay
now even where there is no mis translation present there's still a possibility of a gap in perception and er s this research identified that gap in perception was associated with er with poor outcomes okay whatever the particular problem was that the bigger the UNK the worse the outcome around
okay let me just finish this section then we'll take er we'll er we'll take a break to er take a break for the rest of the day actually yes
erm in terms of communication up an organisation if that doesn't sound to rude but erm okay from the bottom of the organisation to the top of the organisation there's a hell of a lot less of it okay
there's far more communication flowing down than there is flowing up
there's a very old study by walker and guest nineteen fifty two and i think you might find the findings may reflect the fifties quite a lot found that seventy percent of assembly line workers erm initiated upwards communication
in other words initiated communication with their supervisor erm less than once a month okay
so very little UNK of communication up the hierarchy okay
now this may reflect the UNK it may reflect er traditional manufacturing practices in ah probably in the u k erm if you look at managers manager are at a y'know most managers are mid point in communication UNK
you'll find that by and UNK i'll put that on the board for you and UNK nineteen eighty six found that managers only direct fifteen percent of their communication upwards okay
so managers erm essentially communicate downwards okay
they may be UNK with from above but the communication that UNK they UNK only fifteen percent of that communication is initiated upwards
speculate why not of course
why t why c why do they not communicate upwards and i think essentially people it in UNK positions are about managing the UNK others have of them and tend to believe the notion no matter how true it is that er that organisations may have a shoot the messenger philosophy yes
nobody likes to be the UNK of bad news
you don't want to be the one who tells your boss that er a production line has broken down again or y'know that they've failed to meet their sales targets for the third month running whatever it is okay
people like to present good news like to present themselves UNK and of course organisations many organisations do in practice have a y'know shoot the messenger y'know if the messenger brings bad news shoot the messenger er philosophy
y'know as a manager you don't want to hear problems you don't want to hear bad news you don't want to hear disaster
it's very easy then of course to punish the person er who UNK that with you er which ultimately can er totally divorce an organisation from the reality of what it's actually doing so that kind of philosophy very destructive in terms of er effective communication
okay well next week we'll carry on with this material looking at communication networks
now i'm sure you'd like to know what i'm gonna be teaching next week apart from this so if you'd like to read ahead we'll be looking at decision making in organisations okay
if you'd like to try and find that
i don't think that's in arnold sorry
oh it's not next week
it's assessment next week
sorry about that
can i speak to as well please
so can i speak to and to if they're here
gotta get through with a prayer now
what do you think of the new room then
it's warmer
i don't like the layout very much though
now this is as far as i'm concerned this is the last lecture you're gonna get off of me
we've got a seminar coming up and i think i'll arrange to show UNK
er hands up who saw the horizon programme on UNK okay so you don't want to see it then do you really
you
you only saw the f oh now oh right so hands up who saw it all the way through and would not want to see it again as part of the seminar
one two three four
so four of you don't want to see it
what shall we do then
we can arrange the seminar to have different slots so the ones who don't want to watch UNK we can discuss erm what would you like to discuss
i'll come up with a topic
UNK we're not doing that
we're doing that today
okay so i'm covering the exam stuff today
but you can use the UNK slot as erm a revision thing you come and have a chat with me about the course or we can show the video
what i'll do is arrange to show the video for the seminar in case you haven't got any questions yeah
you normally haven't anyway
i mean you don't normally don't want to talk to me
UNK
play to the sympathy if nothing else
okay now what i've got here are two handouts UNK or UNK together as one
now these represent two lectures on group processes that're given to the first year social psychology students at aston
these aren't my lecture notes they i UNK them off the social UNK and made copies last night
some of you will only have two sheets
erm if that's the case you'll notice that the two copies that you've got have the writing on the back
so some of them have got both sides some of them have got a mixture
some of you will only have three sheets which the last one will have it on two sides
so whi what i'm trying to say to you is that you should have four sides of written text whether it's on two pages three or four what i will do is go through the headings and give you a very brief description of that so that you know roughly what's in them
i'm not gonna spend a i mean there's a good couple of hours talking here and w i'm gonna use the time more UNK i think talking about other aspects of the course
now starts off most of it taken from social psychology text books
er and is the sort of standard one that we were using at aston when these handouts were written erm but you should find that the same sorts of things are discussed in or in UNK
i think has probably got a better coverage on groups
i'm not sure but i think it has
it turns out that trying to define what a group is quite difficult a what UNK a group of people from a UNK of people er a group of people UNK at a bus stop are they a group well you don't think so normally
so erm the first paragraph there deals with erm how people have defined groups
no definition is spot on really you can always find difficulties with it but they do sort of discuss it in the first paragraph
the next one is saying okay do people change their behaviour in the presence of others
well really that's l by and large what groups is all about so it's clearly that they do and there's some cases here of sort of cyclists cycling harder and faster when they've got they're training with other cyclists or erm when they're training against the clock
some sort of buzz words known as social UNK and social UNK which come from the work of UNK
looking at how people's behaviour or performance is either improved or UNK from in the presence of others
right so we talk about social UNK and UNK
it's an all UNK term actually and it could be taken across many aspects
you can link it up with the work on that was done on human performance
it turns out that if you're gonna give a talk or something and it's a talk that's well UNK and well known you give it better when there's a lot of people in a passive audience than when there's one or two
however if it's something you're not very confident and sure about quite often the presence of other people makes you fall to bits
if you ever try to do a ha a demonstration for anybody erm or a group of people involving a sort of manual skill you find that it goes to pieces if it's not a very well UNK skill whereas you find you can actually get very your performance is a lot better when you've got an audience if you know the skill very well
you find it in motor skills
i think that's mentioned in there as well
erm distinction made when you're sort of talking about audiences th the sort of participating audience where we UNK and there's the one where i sort of talk to you and you're passive that
groups have been sort of defined in different types of groups
people try to UNK what sorts of group or characteristics there are of groups and you find that people look at group size let's go through the list group size communication networks roles and expectations UNK and rules okay well roles and expectations UNK and rules slightly different
so what it's talking about there is how you can actually define a group
i mean if you allow everybody in the group to have free access to everybody else in the group you may get a sort of different characteristic erm than if you only allow certain hierarchy to exist within the group certain lines of communication
a lot of work done in the fifties by a chap called and perhaps i think is was a later work based on the early work of i can't remember exactly
okay it starts so what we're talking there in text books you'll find they define groups in terms of their structure and their composition and they're the sorts of things that they usually pick out okay there's a lot of work then on interaction in groups
you can link this also up with the work that was done on conformity with the ash experiments
d'you remember the video where you had a group of people all agreeing different sizes and group size was an important aspect of erm whether or not people tended to conform
so you can link that up with the earlier work that we did
there's a list of references there
well they're there for just covering the ones that're in the handout
i don't expect you to actually read any
go and read if you're gon a good introductory si social psychology book like and
your duty
what is your position in all of this
are you
regarding this you mean
yeah
we there's don and myself two individuals who have been on the course for incident training with fire brigade
right
that's why we've come to be the two individuals who are in inverted comma responsible for whatever happens during an incident
how long ago was the course
oh god my UNK in the office somewhere
what we talking about
five years
four years
no it's
wha what'll it be about er about two years i think
right
and that's a shot in the dark
quite a current
oh yes
by all accounts
we were sent by the UNK here you see
right
the pair of us on a course over there
erm now in my wisdom i thought that obviously considering we're now classed as incident stewards the o the thing to do was to put the certificates up in a prominent place so that everybody who visited the site knew who were the incident stewards were
right
so i left mine to be done with and er where it's gone since then is anybody's guess
right
because it was before just before we moved the offices but it's kicking around somewhere in an envelope with my name on the front of it but where i wouldn't know
but don apparently took his
right
but i said to don well i would have thought they have had to have been displayed er to support the fact that they do have incident s you know trained incident stewards on site
did you draw that up
along with erm robin yes yeah
it's quite comprehensive isn't it
really but er to be out of date
it's out of date in certain areas there are cer we'd never you see what we did we knocked up a rough copy
then we e enhanced it and then eventually er robin knocked this up you see from all the work we'd done but we never sat down and went through this
now there are one or two little things in here which have become UNK you look at it but he'd UNK he'd passed this over to the fire service who were very happy with it
right
and that's the way its it left we left it but of course as i mentioned to him we'd completely omitted UNK which of course we hadn't done UNK at all
mhm
er erm we have since had the alteration in our structure here which of course puts quite a bit of it out of date
yeah
but i if you see a all he said to me UNK is closed at the moment he said er
yeah but
but UNK is gonna be open in the summer and if anything happen in the summer
mind you its open now because
w
the fish and chips are there
absolutely
and if there's gonna be a fire it's likely to happen in that fish and chip shop
but t to me it's the biggest fire risk we've probably got on the site
yeah
pay attention to get the UNK list
yeah y yeah
and get some money that's responsible for UNK
yeah
can't have erm mr doing that cos nobody would understand him would they
so to be a steward or somebody that
is generally at that end of things
i think what we've got to do one of the things we've got to do is it's alright talking about a steward as an a n other but i think we've gotta know where the a n other is
we don't name him but whoever is in a particular spot should be responsible for a certain area which in fundamentally it is done that in quite a number of instances but i mean one thing that springs to mind is that a lady shall clear the ladies toilets
mm
what lady where from
who
specify from one of the bar a particular bar wasn't it
yeah but is there a lady in that bar always
generally yes
generally
but it it's UNK law that it will happen there isn't a lady there behind the bar
well really if there's a fire does it matter whether it's a lady or UNK that
i don't think so but we've specified in here a lady shall
see upstairs we say the steward will clear the toilets
well what do you reckon mandy
i mean if you
matters if it's a
if the fire alarms going off and you're in the ladies loo
an and a bloke sort of is shouting from the doorway to clear the place
mm
i think in a er incident like that i don't it matters whether it's male or female
no i do agree with you but i
a lady in there
yeah
there's only one thing that struck me when i was reading through it but a as i say we got to look at this from point of view are we going to date this as it lies at the present moment and add to it pieces that we want or do we start off by having the pieces o i its now whe w
i would have thought first of all we've got to update what we've got as it
yeah
i think it's a good document
secondly then we've got to add
to it
to it
the areas that have been demolished and
yeah
and
yeah
changing meeting points and things
the other thing i wasn't sure and this is just my thoughts on it you are using the stewards as points where they're going to be you know coordinating people and everything
with so many visiting stewards all the time we haven't got a regular pattern of any stewards that's going to be responsible
a absolutely
so it's all in all must be done by staff
yeah
it must be
you cannot rely on stewards because you know they're not here all the time
er what we have got to do you see a as i have said we really got to UNK a duty to a position
mm
as opposed to an individual because our staff is switching round all the time
yeah
the they day staff so consequently whoever's in a UNK specific position has got to have the responsibilities that go with that position
the sta the static point are the bars
yeah
so
that's
using don upstairs
yeah
using ray and jenny
yeah
and mike and geoff
yeah that's fine
and as UNK
yeah
they're also very much aware about evacuation procedures anyway
yeah
so i think we ought to you know use that
but then you see you've got places like the weighing room jockeys areas which basically y you've got temporary staff there or casual staff
erm
which sometimes does UNK not always
you've got temporary staff on the gates
right
erm that's why er you know really i it is essential that certainly who ever is going to be in that position knows what
right first of all
there's one generally static person in the weighing room
yeah
that's the clerk of the scales
yeah
i know he's only casual staff but he's always on the same always
yeah
the same job
but yeah clerk of the scales yeah
what do you reckon
ted or the clerk of the scales
yeah
not yeah what do you reckon
ted or clerk of the scales
i think y yes i think this is sensible
er if we can put people in positions where we know they're always gonna be there a as a permanent UNK a as part and parcel of their job
so whoever is clerk of the scales bend to his
the UNK point about him is he's a he's always based in the same place
absolutely yeah
right and he got a radio
yes
so he's in touch with erm everybody because
yeah
he's got he's got the main radio hasn't he
yeah
erm so he can be a point to the erm what am i looking for
well really w we're
to the of the course
we merely put the onus on him don't we to say right if an incident should occur it gives you responsibility whether you delegate somebody to assist you to make sure that all that area the jockeys rooms and
yeah
e everything
is that all
erm i it will be covered but
free to do it though cos he isn't
mm
i don't know whether he might be a bit funny about it
i don't know whether it would be a bit better having someone like ted
you know do you know
i know what you mean
do you know what i'm getting at
yeah
the on the only thing is sometimes if you a if you ask some of these people to do these things i know it's not a lot of responsibility but do you reckon it goes to his head
yeah oh yeah i know i know what you're saying
as it is
he's the only other sort of like
erm
static one there isn't he
you see now all that was left before to the office staff
cos the offices were down there
it was all adjoining wasn't it
you see
so it was all you won't find it in here because as erm robin said the office staff are there that'll be the central position where everything's happening and they will make sure that the area's clear
but now that we've changed the thing we've got to this is something we've got to add into it
yeah
the fact that the offices are no longer there but somebody's gonna have to make sure that all that block is cleared and the only person permanent UNK is clerk of the scales as you quite rightly said
yeah
we'll do it as clerk of the scales and er we'll inform him that that's on you know one
yeah
of his duties as clerk of the scales and we'll have a notice put next to him as well about the procedure
yeah
and give him a copy of all his
oh yes yeah
now he will see that the whole of that block is cleared
not here
where would they be UNK to
to the paddock
the everybody UNK to the paddock area behind the main stand
yeah
er after deliberate first we wondered whether they ought to go through onto the UNK and then we decided no probably the best place for them would be round the back of the main stand
mm
erm now whether in by doing this virtually the UNK spot but it's the easiest spot to UNK them from and it's the easiest spot to get them to
yeah
the if there's a large number of people
er they're easily UNK there because there's no UNK
if they're going through the course they've got to cross the course they've got to cross the UNK
yeah
that could create a problem
erm if we're gonna move them out to the back there there's firm standing f to get them out there the
firm would get there without any great problem and once we got them there we can di UNK them without any great they're not in the way of essential services if they want to come in
yeah you're not encouraging people to go to where the cars are being parked
or whatever we don't really have the time people just say oh it's charts
erm and i'm responsible really for the historical side of the business not only the all for all the UNK and erm that kind of thing and UNK the house but also for its future as we hope a living history event in the UNK of time
we've at least two or three years to go before that happens
also for the audio tour and generally for making sure that everything is kept on an even UNK historically and that people keep on the right lines
there is also a staff of er other people the ones that you already know michael who is really responsible for the as it were welfare of volunteers and there's another er what four people aren't there
er also who do i'm sure
no they er they do things like fund raising and er the office and there's obviously somebody who the posters and design work and guy UNK and that sort of thing
now what i'd like to do today is to erm take you round the house in a moment or two see what you think of it and really to treat this as something whereby you see if you want to come and help us
and we see whether we think we can tolerate you
erm that's putting it UNK because erm obviously being a volunteer is a sort of two way thing we couldn't run without volunteers we're very grateful for the ones we've got but so it's clearly a matter of whether you decide and whether you like the way we like to run things or not
and we've had people quite often in these sessions eventually have said well no i don't i don't think i will
because er there's too much because they didn't like the way things were run something like that and on occasions we have had to say to people we're sorry we just don't think you're the right kind of person for us
so it is a sort of selection process a sort of mutual selection process
and the first thing i have to say a about the way the place runs is that it doesn't run like an ordinary museum nor does it run like and ordinary house
like for instance UNK house or anything like that
they're guides and stewards are really partly kind of guards
now that doesn't really work here because we have a policy that we don't have notices you may have noticed already we don't have notices saying don't and we don't object to people sitting on the furniture handling this and that doing what they like
in fact we actually encourage them to do so
we don't say you can't take photographs because we actually like them to take photographs we do reckon it's a little bit of publicity for us
and we have never apart from i think we've lost one UNK which was the since we started so er we don't leave valuable things around but it's an important consideration to think that our most valuable things are things it would take four large strong men to move
i mean like the heavy furniture
so i say that first because we have in the past had people who felt worried by this attitude they felt you know that they really they were people who perhaps had a background in the national trust and who really felt that it was their job to say oh no don't touch that
now in fact that's not what we like our stewards to do what we like our stewards to do is actually to help people to enjoy themselves to help people to erm to enjoy the house and to sit on things and actually say no please sit down on that if you like to it's perfectly alright that's what it's for
erm also i mean and to help them with the audio tour because the audio tour despite all our efforts to be clear about how it works continually UNK people and they sort of oh where am i thought i was in here
so you will eventually get the opportunity to take as mike has maybe already told you get eventually get the opportunity to take the audio tour yourself so you can see where things are
erm the audio tour er and just to say something about it is in the process of being revised
there are two audio tours there's the short one which simply says this is here and that's there that's that
and it's just two voices quite sort of one man's voice and one woman's voice
then there's what we call the long tour which has got seven characters from the UNK history on it
robert UNK the UNK plays william UNK er and it's the tour is just about to be re cut er so that UNK can be introduced into it as lady
at the moment we have a tour which has somebody else playing lady but we've got UNK now so that's that
and both these tours enable people to go round the house on their own
right that's something about the way things work and as we go round i'll tell you know what the precise duties cos they are various of the er of the er the stewards are
and what are the rewards well what we find and i must say i was really touched by it particularly with some of our stewards they say that they really like they love the house and they feel it's their own
i mean we've always encouraged people to feel it was their own
erm we do try and be nice to them we do try and give them presents occasionally like little you may have seen some of them wearing little UNK head UNK which er are part of the arms of william that we had made
we actually at long last now the UNK nearly over are having made for them some big heavy red UNK for those who are standing on duty in the UNK
er not to costume them you understand but simply because a UNK is something that can be worn by a man or a woman and can be worn over whatever you have on
and er it took us a long time to get the special material because as you will gather we tend to do everything properly so we had to have the a cloth specially UNK er UNK of course and especially UNK and for once we had it especially UNK in other words the UNK was raised
but water UNK er water UNK erm wooden UNK in the museum textile industry so it's ever so accurate
erm been there before
i think it's probably sensible in a moment if we actually take the a walk round the house
mm
er in the way that we would if we were visitors
but first of all erm i'll just say something i'll say it inside cos it's a bit cold out about the history the background of the house
we're actually in a part of barley hall now accidentally except that this part has been so UNK that we haven't incorporated into the medieval house it's used as an office
but the whole house was acquired by the york archaeological trust in nineteen eighty seven
at that time it was a kind of derelict brick structure part of which er over there the bit that's at right angles to where we are now was in a was a UNK or had been and this part was actually derelict and had a UNK order on it
er it had been bought previous to that in nineteen eighty five by a local UNK who wanted to turn it into offices but when he got his architect in russell UNK who's his architect
when he got his architect the architect said look what you have underneath all this brickwork is a complete shell of a medieval building
and when the UNK er realized he very UNK sold it to the trust er i believe the same i don't know i believe it was the same
and we began the long process of actually sort of causing it to be UNK
i think what we'll do is we'll go down to the UNK and i can show you more erm how that was done
what we'll be doing at first then is just to take an overview of the house you wouldn't necessarily get that on an ordinary tour
so shall we do that now the UNK and er
unless there are any questions you want to ask before we even start
ah no
no the questions probably come later don't they
if you come and stand over here
so when the trust acquired this house it looked nothing like this at all er it was all there was hardly any timber showing the only timber showing was what you can actually see now is obviously old timber
all the walls were covered in brick here this piece of the building was actually only at that time only two UNK high
again all covered in brick
this yard was just a kind of UNK yard with a with a wall along there where you're standing and a few lean UNK
so no one could have guessed really what was on underneath here
er it was known by archaeologists and the royal commission of ancient and historical UNK had done a survey but it had only done a very brief survey and they said this is part of something left of a medieval building here
they weren't really aware
mhm
so once the trust acquired the house it began to do a number of it began to do three things
it began gradually to peel off the brick skin and to find out what was underneath
often the timbers were no more than columns of sort of UNK dust because they hadn't been able to breathe in this kind of brick envelope
often they were missing altogether and there was just a kind of gap where the timbers were a sort of hole in the brick
a kind of er reverse erm like a mould really
but as that was done all the timbers were either photographs or their UNK were drawn or they were er sometimes they were even rubbed like a brass rubbing to see where they joins were
and also if they had a timber like that one there where they had obviously a joint in it the position of the joint was marked
so that was done the plans established and then being an archaeological trust the UNK began to see what was under the hall
and that was done piece by piece as it was possible to do it
this UNK was shut for a few months and we hello
hello
we took it back down to its medieval level
so in fact we dropped the UNK in nineteen ninety one that was the line of the UNK the horizontal line along there
so in order to get back to the medieval level we took it back down to there and we caused the to slope
those of you who know york will perhaps remember that you used to have to duck if you were any height at all to get underneath there well you don't now
it's not because you've got any shorter but we've dropped the
whole level
so UNK was done i i'll keep this short because it's cold out here you see why we need the UNK
mm
UNK was done and then also the UNK we have was continued
in other words who owned it why when was it built and so on
oh and the fourth thing that happened is the timbers core samples were taken out of the timbers and they were sent for erm UNK
tree ring UNK
well that came back everyone's hearts in their mouths
erm that said that this part of all ten samples came out the same ten tree ring UNK samples and said the timbers er of which that had been built had been UNK in the spring of thirteen sixty
and they said may which we thought was it a bit really but they said it had the spring wood but not the summer wood on it
so in the spring of thirteen sixty and they said that this was much more complicated most of the timbers dated from about fourteen fifty although there was one that dated from twelve eighty nine and clearly was renewed and one of the roof timbers was about fifteen twenty perhaps a repair
but by and large fourteen fifty
so thirteen sixty fourteen fifty
by that time i had already established because i did the UNK stuff i'd already established the ownership of the house and the house began life as the town house of a UNK called UNK
er belonging to the UNK black UNK near UNK
and they began it in thirteen sixty the time when york was just beginning to become er the most of importance as the second city of medieval england
they built it as their headquarters of york
not as a church people have got the wrong idea we sometimes get these tour guides going round saying oh was there a UNK here
no there was never anything like that
it was simply their headquarters where they came to trade where they came to er perhaps attend law courts but particularly where the prior of came when he came to do services at the minster because he was a UNK of york as well as being UNK or the parish of UNK which gave him a seat in the cathedral
and so he got space to build a house and they began it began this part in thirteen sixty although it's clear that there was an earlier house here perhaps built at the time when they first got the back in the eleven seventies
but nothing of that UNK at all
so thirteen sixty they began that
and nearly a hundred years later ninety years later this was begun here
there was certainly a third wing which is marked by that there
mm
which is er actually exactly the same height of UNK as the UNK on this side
and we think probably it was a parallel wing probably also of thirteen sixty
here briefly because we'll see them on the inside you've got the main bed chambers above
here you've got the hall you've got the UNK
in that wing possibly more UNK possibly some UNK possibly a little UNK or chapel since they were UNK
l long after they built this however they let the whole house out
they UNK the whole house out to a man called william
partly because they themselves were running short of money er they had a er lost a lot of UNK and they'd spent a lot of money UNK their abbey church their UNK church over at
and partly because york was going down the UNK a bit in the fourteen fifties as well
and so they decided they didn't want their house any more and they would lease it to citizen
they UNK it to a man called william who was a UNK
this man UNK sheriff lord mayor of york member of parliament for the city er master of the king's UNK an important man a local man come up in the world quite a lot cos his grandfather had just been an UNK living on the corner of er UNK lane going up and up and up
his own son UNK son who was called erm moved out into the country married an UNK and became a gentleman with a coat of arms
rise and you got UNK and UNK and UNK then you became a gentleman
and that er that's what happened to the 's and they're still about actually
we still hear from some of them
they've gone down in the world again a bit
still around
erm so that is and what we're doing is to try and UNK the appearance of the house as it was not in the time when the UNK had it but when william had it because we know a lot about him and his family and also we know more about the UNK of that period
and what we shall eventually do is to turn it back when we've finished UNK it we'll put the people back in again
have it as a working medieval household
but that's a long way off
mhm
but at least two years because it would take us that time to UNK the house
let's not get any UNK we'll go and go in
as you'll see one of the jobs that the volunteers do is to stand here
it is un UNK quiet even for us by the shop i think
aren't you cold
not really
my feet are cold
we've got six meetings and today so
oh heavens
yeah
new volunteers
this is the shop as is self evident and one of the i said there were some benefits erm the stewards do get a discount in the shop
yes they do yeah
the point about the shop is that erm it sells things on a medieval theme and more specifically it has we have this undertaking that if you see it in the house you can buy it in the shop
er a lot of the things are made specially for us for instance these UNK
which are based on an example one of the only two example of york made medieval UNK in yorkshire UNK
so we shall use this at our great UNK which i'll tell you about in a moment when we go round which is our next event
so goods with a medieval theme some of them very special like this UNK glass which is we're the only UNK in the country it is very expensive but it is very lovely and each piece is UNK
erm so you do get a discount on that
but if you were a visitor you would start your tour here
cos you would come and you would buy the ticket from linda who would give who would give you a or from if he was here
and you would you would take your ticket then and that would be your entrance ticket
so this is where you would start off
do come back anyway here and have a look round at some of the other things but that's the point of the shop to sell things with a medieval theme
mostly things connected with the house although we do again another thing we've taken to selling these eastern european
direct they come directly from
and also because we're very keen on textiles these special UNK wearing which are these UNK
erm anyway that's where you start your tour and you get your ticket and you sort of wave it round here
see you later
thanks
see you later
you wave it round here it's a good day isn't it apart from being cold
it is
now this is where you come in erm and this is where we've done something which er we think is quite clever this here is the back UNK of barley hall and when we got it was not medieval at all there was no timber UNK left it was just this er brick here so we didn't want to UNK it up to look medieval on the outside
we thought that would be not at all the thing to do a bit too UNK
on the other hand we did want to keep it medieval looking on the inside so what we did was we installed these yorkshire sliding UNK but on the inside as you can see at the top window we put panel window
so once you're inside you're in a medieval environment
all your outside is not too UNK
er eventually we hope to have a little victorian style garden here cos this is a bit bare and UNK
but at the moment we haven't got any money so we can't do that
so you UNK your tickets and you come in to here
hello these are the new
morning
new
the new intake
new intake
are they new erm ear UNK
they are charles
do they go with the new we're they gonna go with the new sound system
yeah
oh good
is UNK one of our most valued volunteers and part time cleaner
erm so you'd come in here and you would be asked well you would be asked what would they be asked whether they
well first they want to know you know which wh we've got a new system haven't we
mhm
put down for the you know for fire precautions and things
mhm
so do they go down as a new intake
search me i don't know
oh five six seven eight
yeah
so erm well first you welcome them and then say erm you know how much time have they got because we offer two tours
one takes twenty minutes which is dr is taking them round and telling them about the hall
and the other one takes seventy minutes or longer if they wish to examine things
and then when they've decided which you'll have erm the slip from the shop
mm
and you put long or short tour and then the numbers
right
on the UNK down
and erm usually if there's space you ask them to sit just to listen to the introduction and then move on
and they go around er and you warn them about the erm the steep steps into the rooms because the oak is quite deep
and if they have children to take them up on the wall side of the stairs because you know
and just wish them good
and give them a guide book as well
well i think
yes you yes that's right
because in here y they have
you'd better have one of these actually you'd better
yes
each have one of these
thank you
erm just so that you can er take it away and have a look at it later on
do the tours cost the same for each
yes they do
yes entrance and er no it's up to them whether they're just visiting
mm
or whether they're really are interested
occasionally you'll get people who don't want to take at all
that's true
you don't have to
but they don't really get much out of it i suspect if they don't
erm it's usually sort of teachers and people who just like to see erm ahead for the school class to bring them later
but in that case you just take a piece of new paper and put the down and put it on the clip
so when they bring the UNK back i find it easier because you can get in quite a rush at times and you can't keep up with
if you put the UNK on there although we should be having a new system
but still they seen checking up don't they dr
yeah
well
so then yeah mm
it it's not that complicated
no it's just getting the rhythm of doing it really
but sometimes it gets quite busy and it's
saturday but that was a result of that radio programme we had eighty seven people time of year did they
oh good
yes
and they'd all took the long tours you know they really were interested
we've a new sound system coming and that's going to be mounted behind the there's a there's a great hole behind there you know which is actually the size of the range of one of the medieval kitchens
i say one of the medieval kitchens cos the kitchen seems to move about a bit er at different times
but this is the room eventually we're going to use i mean not for a long time yet as a working medieval kitchen
working when we've got the household working
but at the moment we need it desperately for what it is which is a kind of entrance and p place where people can sit and begin their tour
the idea of the tour which you can take yourselves
the idea of the tour is so that they can actually er listen to it but they can turn it off whenever they want and they can use their guide book to see what is in each room and if you look at the UNK as we go round you will find that the things are illustrated you know the pot
and this is erm this is a pot that we had made after much
iron
no it's bronze which is even more difficult
er it is rather heavy but you're welcome to carry it
it's a it's a bronze pot a bronze cooking pot
er a cast copy of one in the yorkshire museum again
erm they're awfully difficult to cast because the art of bronze founding on that level is at least as far as i can see almost died out i'm having terrible i've terrible trouble with getting bronze cast
that's just an example of one of the things we've had made and that particular was sponsored as many of our pieces are
that was sponsored by british sugar
that cost nine hundred pounds to make but that's because it was the original
if we can ever persuade them to make any more there should they should be cheaper
but so
newly made
oh well yes because that's
original
no and we even if we were offered them we wouldn't take them because the logic of the thing is that what we're trying to show is a medieval house as it looked when it was nearly new
mhm
so even if somebody were to offer us a piece which they wouldn't i'm sure a piece of old medieval furniture we wouldn't take it
that being the first reason the second reason is because it would put an UNK burden of security on us
mm
now if somebody UNK that it's an awful nuisance but that's all it is
erm and in fact more that and all our more valuable pieces are marked because they are so close to the original that er you have to mark them
mm
for the sake of the UNK otherwise they would be t probably passed off as the real thing
you could pass that off as the real thing
cos it's so like the original and oh you can't really test er metal for date well not without a lot of problems anyway
now we don't have any new things i should have thank you for asking the question because we're trying to give the impression of a medieval house the what's special about this is that it's a medieval house as it looked when it was new
since we had to renew so much of the timber we thought we would turn that to good account rather than trying to we don't want it to look as if it's five hundred years old
so one of the things that suppliers are told is they must on no account stress or age or mess about with any UNK
it's gets UNK quick enough doesn't it on its own
yeah
erm so i mean this is this is never UNK but it's beginning to look a bit ancient now
so as they go round they get they look at their UNK they're told all the are
erm
and er if they're on the short tour there's just a straight you know says this is the kitchen and this would be this that and the other
if they're on the long tour at this point the UNK is pushed aside by the man playing the part of the cook
so they go from here into the two little rooms where food is prepared
this is generally the food preparation area of the house this is a bit further on this is the UNK
come in if you want to
this is the UNK where which is nothing to do with butter but it's where erm the drink for the house was kept in barrels or UNK like these
now the smell you can smell is new oak actually
these are new oak barrels made for us by UNK er the these two are full of water because otherwise they'll dry out and that will happen to them
in other words the rings will come off
oh yes
mm
that one is deliberately being allowed to dry out because it's got to be re UNK cos it never worked properly
er this is a long sort of type of er barrel used for probably UNK wine
these are more likely barrels for either water or perhaps wine or ale although ale is different from beer cos it doesn't have any UNK in
ale was not often kept in barrels cos it didn't keep long enough to want to have enough of it
mm
so these have been made for us by UNK they're made of new oak with er instead of metal was used
they're bound in wood aren't they
mm
metals was used for barrels but only for ones that were being taken a long way away like wine barrels that were being taken to or from UNK
they were much more expensive they were called barrels UNK or barrels with iron on
mm
these are made of er hazel stripped bound with UNK
we have actually had a sort of barrel expert er who told us about this
and then the bucket too which has been kept full of water to keep it from expanding and UNK which otherwise it would do
er is done in the same way
so we haven't yet put the tiles on the floor because again we can't afford to
erm er this area was UNK like the great hall in a rather plain way and we shall UNK that again
the kind of these are the kind of things that we're using for drink
these are salt UNK
erm of a type UNK of a type made in germany and i imported here in very large numbers
salt UNK
that is erm you chuck in rock salt when the k UNK is very hot and then run like UNK cos it sends up hydrochloric acid
erm so that's salt UNK
erm these are quite posh drinking cups called UNK
and they were the UNK of these were made in a place called in germany
and UNK be for the UNK and i'll explain the UNK later on as we go on
but this is the nothing like finished but quite soon in the next couple of weeks we shall be putting some windows in here with UNK
and the windows we shall put in here are the type of windows called a UNK which are made of linen and i'll show you one of those later on rather than explain it now
so we're putting a pair of UNK in here
this is the UNK and the next room to it is the UNK
which is pretty bare
so the UNK is er as its name suggests the UNK is actually UNK the place where the pain is kept the dry goods more than the wet goods
so if you can imagine the food being cooked in there and if you like UNK up in here and while the UNK the man who works in the UNK or the UNK does the drink the UNK the man who looks after the bread is UNK the food out there
now originally he would have given it to the UNK who would have taken it out here
follow you
yes you can follow me
he would have taken it out here through the
oh i see
screen door
straight into there
yes straight into there
now that's what he originally would have done you see he would have taken it out of here straight into the hall
now he can't do that now because there's a public UNK through and the public UNK has been here at least since sixteen ninety one
if you just step outside for a minute
as we can see rather UNK here the difference in if you stand back against that wall if you would very kindly erm you see here the difference in level between nineteen ninety
mm
that's the level at which you would have been walking along this UNK in nineteen ninety and about fourteen sixty
that's how much was actually UNK away
the so this UNK has been here since at least sixteen ninety probably rather earlier when the house began to go down the drain as it were down the UNK
and got split up into different little workshops and dwellings
we'll go back inside anyway when these gentlemen have gone past and
thank you
so the public don't do that but i just thought i'd like to show you how
so we're working on the UNK and UNK particularly the UNK
every now and again we run up against what you might call a medieval
erm because of having to do everything as much as we can the medieval way if we were ordinary people and we said we wanted to UNK we'd say oh well we'll go out and buy some tiles
but we can't do that because we have to make our tiles in the way that's most
the reason being that when tiles are made they're made with clay in a big frame and then they're cut with a thing like piano wire
but they have to be dried in UNK before they can be fired
if you don't the damp comes through later on underneath the UNK so we've got to wait till the spring
so there's a medieval problem
well and that's we were delayed a whole month in UNK the whole because it was such a rotten wet summer we couldn't get the tiles
tell me
no the kind of UNK we have in here
UNK
yes
which are much cheaper than the UNK ones being used in the
cos you seem to get them from like all over
well what was here basically
what we know to have been here
yeah
this is the which is actually much further on in its UNK that most of the rooms in fact all it really needs is some cushions and the window glass here
this is the room where we think probably the owners of the house sort of did their business and met their private customers
erm most of the furniture we choose either because we know it from UNK and lists to have been the kind of thing that was in middle class households in york or in some cases like this where we know the 's have actually owned something like this
william was left a red chest of UNK by his grandmother who was called alice in fourteen twenty nine
what's it made of
oak
erm
it's a very funny colour
well you see most medieval furniture of this type was painted
was it
it was usual to paint furniture
mm
and we know that he was left this red chest of UNK so we sought for a UNK chest that's a chest probably actually made in north germany but imported through UNK and we found a yorkshire example in a place called near ripon
and we copied it
mm
not only as to its erm very elaborate UNK patterns and UNK beasts on it like that around here but also as to its colour cos although the original we found was actually UNK when one took when i took a very powerful UNK to it you could actually see the colour in the UNK still this red colour
and so we took a piece off and had it UNK we have a little laboratory which we use to analyse things like that and it turned out to be what we expected the most common colour of medieval furniture was red
you did it by putting a erm a layer of animal skin glue which is made from boiling down old UNK and UNK that's the size that seals the wood
and then us the UNK is basically a red UNK
mm
so erm there it is the red chest as it's known
erm everything is done in the most accurate way we can
so we don't use mild steel we use UNK iron
all the wood is this nearly all the wood is oak cos most medieval furniture is oak
this however is not oak it's sit on it somebody
this is what's call was called in york a UNK chair and don't mistake that for thrown er it's a UNK or c or turned chair
cos the local UNK wood UNK were known as UNK
er cos they threw things rather like throwing a pot
and that's a UNK chair of around about fourteen fifty designed with a short seat so that you lean forward and it's a writing chair basically
you see
it's not a it's not a comfortable chair it's a writing chair
and that is copied from a picture of one that UNK
er a very accurate one which we took all the UNK from the picture
this
it's very wide isn't it
yes it is well we just copied it exactly
it's actually not uncomfortable to sit in when you get used to it
i mean were people sitting with UNK on or something
people were sitting the main point of the chair is to enable you to write and it's actually very satisfactory to write in it's just the right height
er if you're writing
mm
erm this is taken again from medieval pictures and one of the materials we use in this house quite a lot which is horn
so this is these ink horns actually are ink horns
equally these are horn books do pick them up and wander about with them
they were the earliest type of school text book erm which came in about fourteen fifty er to teach your a b c which you just copied and copied and copied until you got it right
make your own ink
er we do make our own ink we haven't got any at the moment
erm and this is the your prayers your latin UNK
erm this table is actually a folding table of a type which very often appears in UNK and german pictures
we don't know if any in england that survive although they are described as a folding table of UNK or a tab UNK which means a table that UNK
and it UNK by means of taking out these two little pegs there you see
i'm not going to do it cos it's full of UNK and then it tips back on itself on to the on to the flat side
erm it's only UNK on the front cos it when it UNK it UNK flat along the back edge
mhm
and it's got these animal feet
if you when you if you're interested go and have a look at your pictures by UNK by people like UNK and er roger van UNK and people like that and you'll find this table keeps well a table like this keeps appearing
sometimes sixteen sides at the top
why did they have a folding table for travelling or
do to make more room i mean the furniture was much less UNK than ours is if you see what i mean
it was this room may think is UNK but is almost over UNK by medieval standards
they didn't tend to have a lot of furniture
and these because you always wanted to be able to adapt rooms for different purposes and this folded back against the wall
that's the it needs cushions
the cushions are being made
it's very comfortable
well it won't be if you sat there for too long
no but it
that if that's an old fashioned design i mean we designed that as being something that his granny might have had
so sort of late fourteenth century
that's actually the very latest thing in primitive carving on here
which is in fact the new UNK thing in fourteen eighty
they just as a storage space
but er there's a UNK there
mm
looking up at the roof the roof of the whole of this hall range and indeed of the other part is done in the same way
it's the tiles are copies of ones found in the foundations and they're hung on hand split oak UNK
these things are UNK
they're split erm along the line of the grain because otherwise being erm they UNK to UNK a bit
if you use if you split wood along a natural grain it moves it UNK far less
mm
and i'll talk about that a bit more
and then they're hung on by pegs and then touched underneath with UNK to stop them lifting off that grey sort of er it's to stop them lifting off
and it's been a jolly good roof i will say it's not let there's never been no problems with it in even in this bad weather we've had these last few years
it's a very good roof
are the pegs attached to the tiles so they hang on the UNK
yes the pegs the pegs go through the tiles so the tiles are made with little square hole
tiles were the ro making the tiles was a major operation because erm when they first tried to make the tiles they tried they dug a hole big hole at UNK and they tried to make forty thousand tiles line them all up in the pit and they brought something like forty tonnes of dry wood UNK from the erm saw mills in er forest but they couldn't quite get it hot enough so the whole lot had to be thrown away do again
so erm anyway they did do it in the end
mm
erm this is another piece of erm import
because there was a tremendous trade between york and the low countries and between york and low and north germany
and this what came in large quantities to fashionable houses like this were erm what was called
UNK
and this is actually from UNK i actually went to UNK to get it er and this is a copy of something which er a direct cast of something which is still in UNK
in er oh where is it in a place called er the pottery in the church museum
and er
it's really elaborate compared with the UNK of the furniture isn't it
mm
well yes i mean it we d it's slightly different they have a slightly different view of things and on what they use a lot more than we do is wall textiles
mm
i'm particularly the textiles i suppose i'm quite keen on UNK on because i think we're far ahead of everybody else with textiles
other medieval houses that are UNK medieval houses just haven't got on to the textiles in the way that we have
these textiles to be brief are the type called in the UNK say
s a y the type of cloth is say
it's a light but closely UNK cloth and the UNK is based no medieval cloth UNK survive
UNK do cloth UNK don't
erm the ta the UNK is based on the discovery of a seal an seal were the royal officials who were responsible for the quality of UNK cloth
and some of these were found in bristol harbour er and the pattern of the UNK was pressed in to the lead so we were able to put a UNK to that and see how it should be UNK
they're UNK as you see on thirty six inch wide hand UNK
just with a without a flying UNK passing the UNK back and forth
they're UNK also naturally in the medieval way with red for the UNK and then UNK to give the yellow as the basis of UNK and then a UNK an UNK from UNK erm slightly UNK there because we couldn't have enough UNK we have to use import the actual substance
so you UNK it yellow and then you UNK it blue and it goes that green
we are planting four acres of UNK in order to have a blue bed for next year cos there isn't enough UNK is in rather short supply so we have to grow our own
so these are UNK erm hung on UNK directly UNK straight into the wall
no rails or anything like that
the UNK that are UNK used for stretching or UNK the cloth in the process of making it
and you just hammer them the poor old cloth workers they've got used to me now they had an awful fit at the time you can't do that
i said yes i can stick it straight on
the idea being that if you wanted to move the cloth which we will be doing for the UNK you just lift it straight off there hammer some more UNK in somewhere else and put it on there as well
erm even UNK like the UNK hunting UNK which you may have seen at the v and a er the tops look as if they're been eaten by mice because they're been so often UNK onto UNK and moved and moved round and onto other UNK they just don't seem to have had the same view of this kind of thing as we do
that's what they were for you moved them around
if you wanted to move them you moved them
i'm going to i'm going to UNK now cos i see i'm going on too long
this is the great hall and i could spend easily as long as i've already spent on this hall but i won't
it's wonderful
this is the great hall which is which is although it looks finished is actually by no means finished i was just explaining to mike we still need a go there we still need a table there we need all the windows to be done and we need three thousand pounds for that window
not so high because of the glass but because it's got to have double folding UNK
and because there isn't enough room for a half UNK you see it's only that wide it wouldn't cover the window
so we're having to have UNK with a central UNK and we're fortunate again in york we've got a wonderful erm UNK only a few hundred yards away in the minster
er i don't know whether any of you have ever been into the little private chapel st UNK chapel which is reserved for private prayer and early morning service
however if you go in there and there's no one to disturb i always look and make sure there isn't anyone first and look at all the wall cupboards the wall cupboards the wood has been cleaned actually are about the largest collection of late medieval UNK in england
because all their hinges and c all their hinges and UNK are all original and they all date from about fourteen ten
so we have a if we ever want any UNK we just have to go and say oh well we'll have one of those please
to the blacksmith
erm as i told you before the original er UNK of the house was that the cooked food was brought through that door through the UNK door and into here as you see
but this UNK was cut through in the seventeenth century if not earlier
so we wondered whether there was a wall here at all of any kind
the showed there was absolutely nothing here
there was just an open space
all there was probably was a hanging and you see there are the actual UNK of the UNK are still visible
and we haven't UNK this wall because we wanted to be able to open and shut this curtain so we've adopted another medieval style taken from erm er medieval UNK
the rail is made of UNK iron and the rings are made of cast bronze
we're fortunate in having an excellent blacksmith called john who's also the UNK blacksmith who manages all our UNK very cheaply we have to d he's so busy we have to just get it when we can
roof you see if you look right up there above this central beam you can see the smoke hole
mm
now this entire wall is exactly as it was in about fourteen fifty when it was built
the reason why that's been preserved is that part of the wall was never UNK in
so that it was always able to breathe
the side walls were UNK in a brick skin they couldn't breathe and we've had to replace as you saw outside virtually all the timber
the er original timber here which is the UNK beam and it points up something very o odd happened in this building
if they had been working UNK they would have built the new on to the old stopping here
but for some reason they didn't for some reason i don't know for some reason they sort of UNK into the of the earlier range causing a couple of hundred years later in the early seventeenth century absolute disaster because the whole of that range began to settle down
and they took a whole level off they've dropped it by a storey
we've put it back up to the storey but we've
so why they did it well why they did it is clear er to make slightly bigger hall but why they took the risk they did is not so clear
i mean you can imagine somebody saying well it'll last me out i'm not bothered
this is where the posh chaps sat
by the big window and with especially grand table which we shall paint incidentally paint the paint the er the carving there
settling down because wood keeps moving for some time
even when as we've done here we've got which is timber which is cut like the UNK of a cake from the outer UNK to the centre
instead of being UNK off in strips like they do actually UNK it from the outside to the centre
quarter which is very UNK when you get to recognize it because it just looks different actually moves much less
what moves much less still is UNK timber
and these legs on these side tables is UNK
in other words instead of being UNK what you do is you take the log and you s look at it very hard to see where the natural erm UNK along the wood are going out from the centre
and then you put an axe in there to make a space you put a
and then UNK it with a huge UNK and it splits along the natural lines of the grain
and that's called UNK or UNK
and that's the strongest way of all of making timbers and looking at medieval pictures and the few medieval UNK that's the way it was done
because these they didn't want your table legs to go wandering about
because it would make the table bend
and these are done very well
these are made by a gentleman called adrian er erm who worked on the house as a as a UNK er but was so taken with it all he took to becoming a medieval furniture maker has been ever since
he's coming tonight to stay to bring the benches which are gonna go on the outside here
er the gentleman coming from scotland on saturday is bringing me all the table linen and we're table linen for
including these tremendously long UNK which are er one and a half times the length of the table because they have to go over everybody's lap as a UNK kind of UNK
mhm
so people would be sitting round four corners of this they had to have a UNK over all their UNK which they did
and all this is being done because on the twelfth of february we're having here a sort of super UNK accurate medieval UNK
er accurate in the sense that there'll be no UNK and no rugby songs and no leg of chicken
what there will be and nor will on the other hand nor will there be any UNK
everyone is going to be given er or lent er one of these er eating knives which we had specially made
and we'll give them a UNK and knife and i won't go into it in great detail but everything is going to be the six courses will be entirely accurately served on bread plates over on UNK
but i mustn't go into that now
but er that's our next excitement after the recent television and radio thing
finally these are UNK read and green perhaps the most popular colours in york
in seventy percent of cases where colour is mentioned it's red and green
red and green say on the bench and bench covers called bankers have been made for these as well they would be covered as well
er that's red say there and these are painted UNK which were very popular in york for those who couldn't afford UNK which were then as now very expensive
they're linen painted with proper er ground UNK
the pattern is er not the white rose of york but the rose of the UNK or the rose of the virgin mary UNK
you see the UNK i h s and then round that UNK so christ in the virgin womb and then UNK round the outside
mm
and this is taken from belonging to the john and you can see it originally in the york minster library
john was a friend of william so we thought that would be quite appropriate
whenever we can we try and do stuff that is as close as possible to this house
we've UNK ourselves a little bit by putting william 's initials on there and the arms of his wife who was called joan
she was a bit UNK than him she had a family coat of arms with three
she came from
as er a little erm er UNK to the people who paid for all this the london UNK company we put their arms on there
we thought it more appropriate than saying sponsored by so we put their arms
so these are the side tables for high table the UNK central UNK central fire place waiting to get the fire dogs for it
smoke went out there
the original beam black and that beam across there is the original beam which is UNK by all the smoke
right the arch UNK of course had to be put in because they were if you look at it you'll see that they were actually UNK off
the arch UNK were UNK off
because when we took over this room it had actually two extra floors in one where you see the UNK and one higher up
so
and we took those floors out cos they were recent and we put these arch UNK back in again using the pattern that
but this hall is not finished yet the UNK itself is a real medieval UNK recycled from
we er
was there an upper floor
no
you say there are holes in the timbers
no i was saying that there was but that had been put in quite recently
oh yes
i see
mm
erm the UNK the hall with the original floor is still preserved about nine inches down underneath a layer of three inches of sand to preserve it
what we found here was the floor with the UNK marks of where the tiles had been
so that we knew what pattern the tiles had been in
and in the corner there where there in fact had been something very heavy the tiles had not been removed but left
so that we had a few tiles that we knew what their pattern and date was
and john our potter was able to
so we've UNK the pattern that we think was here
the UNK was still here
the UNK had been very badly damaged in UNK times and somebody had just dug a pit straight through the middle of it perhaps for drainage
erm well i mean they didn't know it was there you see
mm yeah
so what we've done we thought we're gonna have to UNK that UNK
and then the erm the UNK department discovered a h a UNK of the right date at UNK on the er northern edge of er the city by the ring road
and so since that was going to be demolished and built over by a housing estate anyway we ripped it out and put it back down here
well we ripped up bits of it and re UNK it
so it's a sort of interesting rather UNK object sort of recycled medieval UNK on the site of the other one
this as far as we know which is UNK from the original was for some sort of a UNK
we don't know why it was this little sort of dip that UNK you know the UNK of it but why it was there we don't know we thought we better put it back since it was there
yeah
would they sleep round
no not in a house like this
no this is too grand for that sort of thing
erm i think the only time that people might have slept in here is if you had a visitor who had a lot of servants and there was simply nowhere else to put them
but no the hall by this time was really more a
and not really even a living room for the owners cos they were in the bed chamber
mm
i i'm i say you must excuse me going on at such a pace but i've got a i've got another meeting quite shortly and b you've got some little mo i think m UNK looking to take over
just go on through here
these are the store rooms underneath the bed chambers
the rooms erm we've tried to this has been a bit tied up since the UNK we've tried to have it fairly UNK so that kids for instance if they're not used to sheep can come and come and have a UNK of er you know
they can d they can do that used to sheep
they can they can if they want to take some wool away they can
erm this is like a new UNK
and they can look at the horn and they can look at these things and they can look this is UNK which is the UNK that's used to produce the green the yellow of the green
it produces a chemical called
and this is grown grows round york very commonly on building sites and things like that
this comes from UNK
this is you know what we're gonna be concentrating on next
this awful and we'd actually got the first window here which is which is
now then this is a UNK
and it in the summer which i know it isn't the summer in the summer we just take these well we will cos we haven't had any for the summer we just takes these UNK out and just open them like that in the summer
or we can if we like we can close the UNK at night at summer nights but in the winter if we want to have some light we open the UNK and put the UNK back again either way round it doesn't really matter
these pegs in
is it is it UNK
well it's not i'll tell you in a moment
it's linen i think we'll have it the other way round actually
it's linen and what you do is first of all you dip it in a solution of UNK
i'm not quite sure why
er and then you wash it over with a hot solution of three parts clarified UNK four parts clarified UNK five parts UNK
and this is all we've done is to take a medieval recipe
how to make a UNK and we've just done that and it works
it keeps the rain out it lets a certain amount of light in and it's dirt cheap
erm obviously not used to any ground rooms at all
i think the UNK actually was so because this recipe enabled you to paint them with flowers if you wanted to
right
we might even try and do that
so eventually all the windows will be done like this with UNK and we can get rid of that UNK plastic but it's all quite expensive
these kind of windows are very cheap in fact this one i think cost about two hundred and fifty pounds altogether but when you're doing big er double folding UNK and glass windows and things like that then you're into the thousands
i mean we're doing it because they're cheap
so that's the first one
and no one else i think has got any UNK
er but they do seem to have been quite common in york in less grand rooms
they were follow the tour round
this is the sort of the bedrooms the chambers
this call the lesser chamber because to distinguish it from the greater chamber
and er there's another little room above there where if you move those boards there that is a kind of trap door
perhaps for a servant
accessible only by a ladder
this is a minor bedroom erm but it's got quite a lot of nice original UNK in it
to say that i wouldn't care if there wasn't any original UNK in the place it's not really what i'm interested in
and trying to UNK what it would have looked like
however there's nice light this morning to see the marks of the UNK across that beam the big two man UNK
you know what a UNK is you dig a hole and one man gets down the bottom the other one comes up
and also the marks of the little side axe used for UNK off the sides
and you see all the UNK are UNK not so much for UNK but because they seem to have done that according to latest research done that to take the bark off because it was the bark where the UNK tended to get in
and the poor things english heritage have done erm they've they're UNK a room at UNK and they've got UNK in it and all their UNK falling to pieces it's terrible
erm it really is they should have should have t been more careful in a way but and this you see is a fairly UNK good UNK seem to
mm
now if it had been the north side it would have been a straight line
yeah
wow
so there's quite a few of these
erm around and about the place
erm and also there are in the top i haven't got a ladder i can't show you now some of the UNK cos they numbered the UNK in roman letters one two three four five six seven
originally seven UNK
and we were in some of them when we started off in that sort of office room
so a bedroom here another bedroom here and then the great chamber the most important bedroom
i wonder if you could erm i wonder if you could ask michael to look into that
because it UNK been
right okay
could you or ask
yes
someone on the team
yeah
thank you
the great chamber we don't have great chambers now but sort of the master bedroom private sitting room erm would have had a big bed in it
bed of what was called the hung bed
it didn't hadn't got they didn't have four posts at this time they hung the top part of the bed literally hung it from UNK wrapped round UNK
the UNK was hang directly on UNK rather than on side posts there were no corner posts
so bed in one corner the great bed
also looking at pictures UNK chest with your money your UNK your most precious things in your great chamber
and if you were an important enough visitor you were allowed to come up the UNK and straight into the great chamber
you see if you were not important you went to the hall and waited er for the master to see you
if you were important enough you came up to see him
and e if you look up there that extremely UNK area there is called the crown post UNK
crown post because the UNK come out like the points of a of a sort of pantomime crown
er and there were four crown post UNK or well no five crown port UNK you see half of on there half of one there and a whole one there
partly original partly UNK
because what they did when they UNK i told you they dropped a whole storey
what they did fortunately for us is to keep the roof structure saw out the pieces prop up on posts and then drop the whole roof by a whole storey so it we've still got the roof
otherwise we wouldn't have known what it looked like
now we do
and this is the great chamber and this is where their tour ends i think if we just go back if we go straight back into the place we started and so just finish it off then i must i must finish off as well
erm there's our er our UNK mark there the little hill you see upside down it's a little hill cos he's called john so that's his mark
and are you from the university too
yes
yes
probably with UNK we think as far as we know although there is also a UNK breast there which is a later date
although it may well cover something of an earlier date
it's something we've just had to leave cos it's
how many bedrooms would there have been originally
it's very difficult to say because we've lost this end of the house and we've lost the other wing
yeah
probably about six
about six
i wonder if could do something about the window in the great chamber UNK blowing through
oh we get some coffee
yes
oh let's have some coffee yes
right i'll have some coffee
then i'll leave to you
so i hope i've told you something about the history of the house
you're not required to know all that remember or indeed any of it because they have everything they need to know particularly if they do the long tour they have everything they need to know on the tour and everything they need to know about the furniture well pieces of UNK
on the other hand you'd be very odd people if you didn't take an interest in something in particular some people take an interest in the w wooden frames some take an interest in the textiles or some piece of furniture
some people i mean UNK loves cleaning things so she's spends all her time UNK things cos has to be cleaned very carefully
you mustn't use modern things on them or it'll really UNK them UNK and you've done four thousand pounds worth of damage before you know it
and or course you never use water on an oak floor cos it UNK
so and again i emphasize you've not responsible for cleaning either but UNK just likes we can't stop her cleaning
erm so you're not required to know all that or any of it or much of it
probably if you if you were to absorb the information in that guide book that would be enough
don't this is one of those places where you have to
is there any way you can see these things being made such as the horn somebody working in horn for instance
only by going to their workshop and every now and then we have somebody who well every now and then somebody is fitting something
but we don't we don't
and then can you come and see it then can you come and see it being done
yes if you wanted to yes
the other thing we do sort of every now and then and next time will be easter we actually have some people in costume who actually UNK the house over UNK weekend in this case as the household of william and they've been coming for a long time now and they've got set into the set into their roles quite well
so lady we've never found any gentlemen old enough to play old william because he was in his seventies at this time we never found an old gentleman play william robert UNK not quite old enough
he said he's like to try just not er old en robert UNK our special UNK really here he's very interested in coming to the UNK he was up the other week wasn't he last friday whenever it was
and but we have a lady who is i suppose she about sixty five and she's got really into the part of playing lady
and we have and elizabeth and various people
eventually of course we shall employ people full time to do these things
but er not for a long time
cos we're nowhere near ready for people to move in
and as well
mm oh there's a whole lot of things
the UNK evening once a month on average one of the UNK comes to tell us about the next one is on february the twelfth
mm
on the twelfth
yeah that's john if you can get a ticket for that john is by far the best lecturer among our craftsmen i mean he's just an absolutely amazing character
erm it'll be it'll be erm twelfth thirteenth it'll be the tuesday no i think it's the fourteenth or the fifteenth
yes it is on the tuesday
yeah well anyway
that's the next UNK evening that's john the potter and UNK and he'll be very good
we only have forty seats so if you are interested i'm
these UNK evenings tend to get booked out don't they
yeah
so john where do they get tickets for that
erm the shop i think
yeah
do we think that
yes
erm and then the next one after that is i know is march the fifteenth which is adrian who's the er UNK
and he'll be do a very good show rather a shy man but he will and that will be that will be rather technical if i know adrian but if you if you like he's that's the time to come
we've already had i'm afraid we've already had the and er
i mean er some people we had a lecture on the archaeology
that was specially for volunteers
we try to have events specially for volunteers as well
we have parties and
yeah
christmas
mhm
party
and twelfth night which was
we've got another party coming up as well
have we
nobody tells me anything
when
march
oh
erm
anyway there are there are various
mm
the third of march
erm
good
so
have you got any questions you'd like to ask me about the history
rather than about the working of the place cos
can i just ask about the fact that everything's made of UNK
yes
erm when it sort of begins to sort of season
mm
will the plaster work crack
no because everything was originally made of UNK i mean
yeah but roofs used to get twisted didn't they
yes they do it probably will twist a bit
i would imagine the plaster wall have to be replaced cos there's a lot of work that needs to be done on t we've already had to deal with the UNK once in fact we wouldn't have noticed cos we hadn't seen it before but what happened is that the frame of the hall particularly UNK so that we had gaps in between where the UNK was and where the wood was and we had to have a couple of men that we used for this erm come in with lime plaster and fill in all the cracks for a week or two
and we may well have to do it again
now when that UNK down a little bit more maybe in a year or two we shall lime wash the whole frame over so you won't see the timbers for a bit and just lime wash right over the whole timbers
and if i can possibly we might do it in a kind of UNK colour which is what seems to have been at least on part of the house
UNK you know that you use for marking sheep
mm
the red UNK
the red UNK yeah
red UNK yeah
well they us i mean usually it's red you can have blue UNK but it's UNK is usually red
mm i'm just trying to think what they use red UNK for
marking and sheep just to ma so you know which ones he's served
you put a plate on his chest with UNK on so he marks them as he comes round
funding from to
well the funding is either the initial funding was a fairly brave thing by the archaeological trust from its own funds
there's been no government erm we're now what happens is every now and then like now we just simply run out of money i mean we've simply run out of money
that's why i'm UNK around doing the odd window here and there because that's all that we've got for
er we've got a little few earmarked funds left over like for instance UNK brewery gave us the barrels and they gave us two and a half thousand pounds
we were able to do the hall or we'd still be nowhere with it only because of a donation of thirty thousand pounds quite out of the blue from the london UNK company which meant we didn't expect it
so we were able to complete the hall or complete the hall as far as it's got
we know that we have a little more money coming in the ne in the new financial year from an american foundation but not much
enough i hope to enable me to complete the windows
which is really the UNK most urgent thing
which i hope we may be able to in april because really they are a disgrace at the moment
but erm we can't spend money we haven't go we can't spend money and erm i mean er if we spent if we went on spending money then what would happen is that the trust would simply well it would go it wouldn't exactly go broke but jobs would have to be cut and that sort of thing people would be very badly affected by it so you just have to wait
we're not the kind of thing that attracts government funding cos we're not sort of we don't go along with the UNK you know the UNK establishment really UNK that everything should be exactly just so
have you any idea when it's likely to be complete then
no because i me because i don't know
cos it depends on the money
yes
no probably not in a sense but then when complete enough to actually use is another matter
i just seems like something you could just keep building and building forever
you could do but i mean i the n the amount of money needed for completion sounds a lot but actually it's probably i think two and a half two hundred and fifty thousand to complete
i think
costs tend to be i mean it costs now costs are those of doing things by hand
the UNK for instance in the great hall not including those in the cost nearly ten thousand pounds
oh good grief
well you see hand UNK hand UNK er UNK at fifty five pounds a yard seventy pounds a hard to make
were they done in york
no
no the only firm that does hand weaving and hand UNK on a big enough scale is in west wales in the middle of a place called
and the only horn and we're often dealing with only the only this the only that
the only UNK is in lancashire
blacksmith comes from east yorkshire but i mean he's just a very good blacksmith
but the furniture is made all over the place although 's our best maker and he's up in scotland
erm now let's see the linen is made in scotland because it's the o he's the only linen maker i ian is the only linen UNK
incidentally erm next friday no the friday after so friday the eleventh anyway we're gonna set the whole t erm hall out for the UNK a day early so that people can come and see it
we're going to have guards there to make sure they don't nick the knives
cos the knives are very beautiful they've all been individually made
so er thirty UNK as many
how many people will be coming to the UNK
people we can get in
we've still got some tickets UNK but they are fifty pounds
they're fifty pounds because of economies of scale
thirty people paying fifty pounds makes you fifteen hundred pounds
the food and service is costing eight hundred pounds alone
so in fact i mean we'll be lucky if we clear a profit on it
people say oh that's very expensive but in fact if you think about it probably ought to cost a lot more
but there we are
are you serving medieval food
mm
oh very much so we're serving it all we're serving courses which actually contain the whole meal
so where you have your UNK erm meat vegetables such as they are and sweet
and then you have the whole lot again then you have the whole lot again
and you eat in what is called UNK so that you eat in a mess of four and the server comes in and puts a plate of it might be UNK and a plate of which is a kind of erm corn and er in front of you
and you have a plate per mess and you take as much as you want onto your UNK and your bowl
like that
it should be quite fun cos they have to UNK by UNK got these knives
yeah
er the other thing to come to if you don't want to spend fifty pounds although we'll be very pleased to see you the UNK in the afternoon and there's a lecture in the afternoon at two o'clock
anyway it's advertised by peter who is erm doing the food
and i shall just introduce him
erm in the afternoon at st UNK college and i think that's ab i don't know what it's about two pounds fifty or something
anyway all these things are advertised
yes that's right
he's going to be going to talk about the
we'd much rather you came to the UNK
will the guests be in
no the guests will not be in costume we thought it was unfair that they should make them in costume
the UNK and table UNK will be in costume
mm
erm so there are a few
are the are the UNK from out of town
they have we're having to employ a specially approved you see we've got the health and safety
oh yes
we have to have an approved UNK which and what's gonna happen is that those two room that the room where the UNK and the wool were we're gonna virtually be sealed off
mm
erm so that hygiene laws can be observed
and that's why that's another reason why it's all so expensive
yeah
but we have to do it they'd be absolutely down on us like a ton of bricks if we didn't
i mean we could cook it much more cheaply but we do that then they'd just they'll throw the book at us we can't do it
yes there are
are there specialist people who do this sort of thing
well there are specialist outside UNK she's never done UNK before
mhm
she's actually working under the direction of peter who UNK you may if you're interested in cooking you've probably read books by peter
yes i have
and he's a director of leeds museum well he is at the moment anyway
mm
erm he runs UNK court
mm
the kitchens every now and he's a UNK and he's UNK about cooking
and so every year between christmas day and new year's day he takes over the kitchens at UNK court with his forty assistants and runs them
i mean they had twenty two thousand people round this year it's takes him a week to recover the poor man
anyway come to the lecture erm he's a very UNK is peter
mm
i'm afraid not you can imagine why not can't you
yeah
you'll have to excuse me now erm i must go and you you'll take over
i'll take over yeah
i forget what i'm doing next
i think you have a meeting with somebody else
so i have so i have
well er we're running something else as well at the same time so
it's always this busy
i'm always this busy
erm we hope to see you again erm if you if you want to come
erm anyway mike will tell you all about the details so see you later everybody
thanks very much
bye
bye
this opportunity to welcome you to barley hall again and er i hoped you all enjoyed UNK bit
erm we've got another session on tuesday at ten o'clock so i haven't got a lot to say now
erm but just a few words
the most important thing i think is erm what charles has said about the house erm is quite important
li as he said it doesn't matter if you don't remember it but if people ask you questions and you don't know the answer please send them down
erm people don't generally mind that we can't have people making things up guessing because then we'd the reputation of the trust
which erm is known worldwide
and the house is now just about becoming bodies all over the world and the press are beginning to take attention and the radio and the b c last week
erm and you never know who's coming in it could be anybody and if we start saying things which aren't to then we'll eventually damage the project a great deal
there are a lot of people out there who are UNK who would like to it's very successful and sometimes people don't like success
so that's the most important thing
erm i don't know whether charles has said anything about who people are barley hall charles is the historical consultant he's done all the research
erm my role is as volunteer coordinator so looking after you that's my main job
erm other people UNK you've probably met already she's really like the project UNK she's in charge
peter erm you'll see around from time to time he does all the design stuff erm and christine erm looks after all the UNK and stuff
and she's the office UNK
the main office is in UNK we've got a small office here as well
it's the green door
erm UNK you'll see around as well erm she's in charge of the educational side she books in all the school parties and designs educational projects and so on
she also
and that's charles UNK peter UNK christine and myself really are the people who
erm
erm it's quite important that we give out a very professional
which means that we've got to be polite to people and so on
we're not we do need some kind of commitment from you we don't need a contract
and we do anything from one session a month to
and some people do up to two a week
but one a month is
erm and all we ask is that if you if you've said you're coming to do a session that you do actually turn up and if you can't then if you can telephone us as early as possible to let us know that you can't make it that's not a problem
so long as you let us know we can arrange for someone else to
we have had days when we've had three s stewards scheduled for the morning we've looked at the UNK and thought and we've had no one turn up panic
so but we're very easy with things we don't erm we don't jump up and down and get cross erm so long as we can get some
and people swap their days
how many people do you need at a time then
erm at the moment we try and aim for three for each session
twice a day
yeah
so that's usually six
is that winter and summer
yeah
mm
and that will probably increase as we get into the summer cos the visitor numbers will increase
no
erm some of you haven't in yet do that now
erm
actually you probably know whether you've filled a form in or not don't you
of our officers who work in children's homes we didn't sack anybody who was at the front line of s services and we certainly didn't expect other people to pay for our circus tickets
didn't sack anybody
we actually believe that the people of would prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services
and we actually believe that it's the individual's power to choose
what is now worrying us extremely about local government in britain in any labour authority which is spreading now like a cancer in that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub committee
i mean i'm not that rude as to say that's for the payment of allowances but some people may say that
officers are paid to implement
you can speak in a second
officers are paid to implement our policies
they're certainly not paid to write councillor press releases
here
at least even i never UNK to sending a circular round community and environment saying we do not want the danger of officers actually talking to the public and if there's any credit councillor got to have it
the power to choose the power to choose well if the power to choose in politics is about the labour party choosing their own candidate for the by election and then the national party replacing that candidate well that's a party i don't want to be a party to and that's nothing that we would ever UNK to
we've got to make a quite simple decision
we believe as a party that the power of this county be individual that he or she should have the power to choose
not like the labour party that we the labour party have the power to choose that you don't have the right to own
councillor
your says three UNK governments conservative governments in britain have UNK to give power to the people the right to choose and the right to own
let's just have a look at what you've actually achieved
let's look at your performance
and what a performance
it's worthy of an UNK
this government has managed to combine the worst qualities of UNK and UNK
the tory manifesto of UNK declared we have a goal
it finished up it turned out to be an own goal
their statement in their manifesto says we promise that we will make britain the best housed nation in europe
that was UNK a government report declared there was a million houses in britain UNK for human UNK
we spend less than most of the other european countries on housing
public sector housing investment has been cut by seventy percent
some choice
this government has UNK the housing stock of this country and the tories in this chamber dare to talk about the right to choose and the power to buy
and councillor talked about the UNK the question county council about the right to buy and why have a number of houses been sold gone down
two simple answers one they're not there and b people can't afford them
i remind that we put in a housing investment bid for a hundred and twelve million pounds and were given the right to buy thirteen million
let's talk about the choice of the people that're homeless
why are there so many people homeless
i'll tell you why
it's because of the UNK way that this government treats people who experience financial problems of any kind and those other problems associated with those matters
this government has no time at all for the poor and even less time for people who become poor as a result of their savage policies the policies which cause high interest rates rising unemployment and all because of it's UNK with inflation
let's look at house building and you want to sell houses
well if you want to sell houses why have all the major building companies in this country announced the largest cuts in profits this decade
quite simply because people cannot afford to buy them
public sector housing associations building has been cut by two thirds
did you give the building companies the choice
is that what you mean about choice
give a choice of losing like did two hundred million pound
that's some choice under a tory government
the tories UNK that we UNK council house sales
what's the point of advertising a UNK if you don't have one
where are all the houses to sell
simply they're not there
we as a council have sold fourteen and a half thousand with no facilities to build
the labour government will put that right
but where's choice there
where is the UNK right to own
let's talk about the plight of families
what's gonna be the case
because if we continue with the housing stock that we've got then families living in high rise flats are never ever gonna have the opportunity to own their own house with a garden so the children can play
what choice is that
what choice have you given to the hundred thousand people hundred thousand people whose mortgages have been UNK who have been made homeless by the policies of your government
that's some choice
what choice have you given to the seventy five families that tonight are in bed and breakfast in this city with children
what choice have they got
what choice are you giving the nine and a half thousand people on our council waiting list
and what chance have they got of getting a house
if i lived in ten years waiting list ten years waiting list to have the opportunity if there is an opportunity to come to own or get a three bedroomed house
that's some choice
it's costing half a million pounds this year to pay for bed and breakfast
how UNK it is
half a million pounds if we were to be given the resources would enable us debt charge wise to build two hundred and fifty family houses
what an UNK society it is and what choice have we got
i'll tell the people of who has a real choice
it's the privileged few
the poor or less well off who cannot afford private health and pay school fees
that's what choice means to people
tories are not the party of choice and ownership but the party of restrictions and UNK
choice for the rich means UNK choice for the rest
you mentioned environment councillor and you've a government white paper a common inheritance
and i agree the government claims it's done a great deal for the environment
indeed it has it's UNK the rivers dumped toxic waste on our land UNK the air and UNK the water
you also mention within your document the n h s well let's just have a little word about the n h s let's talk about the UNK dedicated staff working in the n h s who have nothing to gain and everything to lose
let's ask the twelve nurses at hospital how they feel about their own jobs
what choice did you give them
what choice do you give the patients that can't use that ward that you've closed down
what choice have you given the patients who can't use the six other wards that you've closed down
what choice have you given the million people who're on the waiting list for national health service
that's some choice
the seven million pound cuts in the n h s service since the trust
three hundred UNK gonna go
that's some choice
keep your choices we don't want them
this government does not give a damn about the despair and breakdown of family life
their policies are causing this an sorry their policies are causing and this from the party which are supposed to believe in the UNK of family life
we are certainly heading back to victorian times on a tide of human misery
the economy
what choice are you giving three million unemployed people
two UNK within a ten year period
what about the family living on income support on poverty and deprivation
what choice do they have
the old age pension that's gonna get two pound fifteen
thank you very much
two pound fifteen
two pound fifteen
the tory government my lord mayor has for too long denied people the real choice
but if the tories opposite truly believe that they are the UNK party of choice then let them have the courage to call a general election
here
give the people of and this country the opportunity to show them what choice they're gonna make and it won't be a tory government it'll be a labour government
councillor
actually it's quite a good speech from my opposition colleague there but it's total nonsense really
it didn't do anything for the tenants of this city or didn't put any new proposals forward
it went straight away back to the old socialist ideology of fifty years ago
the party choose my lord mayor the right to own one of the fundamental principles of conservative philosophy just as just as with labour UNK philosophy labour will choose and labour will own
that's your philosophy
since the tenants right to buy was first introduced in UNK it's been constantly opposed by labour and indeed the s l d who've taken their fat away
this is in marked contrast to the conservative government which has consistently supported policies to spread home ownership throughout the country giving people the choice and the independence which home ownership brings
but my lord mayor labour were not to know in the early eighties how popular the tenants right to buy would be
over one point two million houses bought by council tenants of their own free will so much so my lord mayor that some labour politicians have had no choice but to do a u turn and give their support to the right to buy
my lord mayor how could they not throw out their socialist ideology when so many labour councillors labour councillors were buying and some in this very chamber were indeed buying their own council house
it's now clear my lord mayor what the labour party has transferred has transferred it's opposition to right to buy in to opposition towards the new rents to mortgage
typically ten years too late
we can see from labour's amendment j that councillor as i said earlier UNK to go down the same old socialist way of providing the very type of housing that is currently failing tenants
lord mayor the labour group in have a way of UNK words about without any action
we've heard quite a bit of it tonight
one word they particularly like is consultation
i would like to ask the current and i emphasise the current housing chairman how much consultation he is being offered to our tenants
has he for instance consulted them with their rights under the tenants charter
has he consulted them on their right to choose another landlord under the government's new tenants choice
has he asked indeed the tenants who have not already bought their home if they would be interested in the government's rent to buy housing scheme
has he consulted with tenants on the benefits of transferring their estates to housing associations
my lord mayor i think not
it's a sad UNK on our present housing chairman when asked in committee about the changing roles of housing associations he said it's a bitter pill to swallow
well my lord mayor with that kind of thinking what hope have our tenants of ever raising their quality of life in our badly thought out council estates
council housing as we know it is not the answer
the role of local authorities as large scale landlords does simply not work
you only have to see some of run down estates for the evidence
it UNK the mobility of the family it does not create pride of ownership it does not give a sense of belonging within the community it encourages crime and with the UNK loss of personal safety
the vast majority of people lord mayor lord mayor the vast majority of people the vast majority of people would wish to own their own home
we are the only party who believe that every family has the right to their own home
finally my lord mayor i welcome i welcome and support our motion quite clearly taken from the brilliant speech made by the prime minister at conservative party conference and when and when the conservative government is re elected next year we will give the people the power to choose and we will give the people the right to own
thank you my lord mayor
councillor
your lucky day
if i may start excuse me my lord mayor by answering something that appears to be confusing the conservative benches
despite my baby faced good looks i am actually old enough to remember UNK i am also old enough to remember UNK so i hope that's cleared up
i'm not gonna go back any further than that
but it does seem to me that can you really trust a front bench that can't work out that i might be slightly over the age of twenty one
if you listen to what the tories are actually saying it's the same old i'm alright jack UNK
i can do it i can afford it i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna get it for me and devil take the
we've heard it all before
we're gonna hear it time and time again in the run up to the election
there was no mention of the rights of people to combine collectively to have their views represented no where in that it was all me
the people at g c h q whose rights you lot took away to joining trade unions where are th where's their rights
are you gonna restore them
is councillor gonna stand up and say that he believes in the right of people to join trade unions
i think not
we should discuss a bit about this document and i too have had the er dubious honour of reading john major's speech and it's nice to see that both tory speakers have actually managed to take half of it each and UNK it
i think they have a cheek to complain about people writing other people's press releases when they can't even write their own speeches they just take a bit of their leaders and claim it as their own
if you have ever actually looked at this document that they have produced for today's meeting it is not a strategy it's not a statement it's just a UNK out of the old stories that have been knocked back time and time again but if they're gonna bring it out let's knock it back again
let's look at some of the issues that aren't gonna be UNK to in other debates today
let's start off with tax
the tories have cut int income tax
certainly congratulations
they forget to mention a few other little things
v a t has risen from eight percent to seventeen and a half percent
national there is no choice in paying your electricity bill your gas bill your water rates where v a t has gone up
don't talk to me about choice with that
national insurance contributions have risen from six point five percent to nine percent and child benefit cuts have cost a family with two children a hundred and fifty four pounds
there was no choice and you're taking away rights in that
the poorest people in the country have had their tax burden UNK since UNK and the tax burden has increased for the average family from thirty two percent of their income to over thirty three percent
UNK
fine
more people own shares but as a percentage of the number of shares held the individual UNK has fallen from thirty percent in UNK to eighteen percent today and if all these shareholders c turned up to exercise their right and their power at the annual meeting of british telecom or british gas or any other to say we think it's UNK the sort of money that you are now paying your chairs and your directors what would happen
they would be out voted by the pension funds the banks the city institutions the UNK of the tory party
we have heard a lot today about the of the trade union
we've heard nothing about
their links with big business
education
the issue about assisted places in the c t c is irrelevant to a majority of the people out there
it's especially irrelevant as you didn't even seem to introduce them when you were in control
we believe that people should have the choice and the choice and the rights that most people want is for their children to be educated in schools without water dripping down the walls where the ceiling doesn't fall in that doesn't rely on temporary classes
that's rights that's choice
if you're talking if you're talking about l m s giving people rights and choice you haven't spoken to that many heads because most heads wanna get on with the business of UNK people not being financial UNK trying to balance inadequate school budgets
most governors also have work to go to and we don't and we don't
i did not say that and you would know it councillor
basically what we are faced with here is the standard tory lies the standard tory attempt to dig themselves out of their hole
it's not a statement it is a waste of paper and you should be ashamed to have bought it
the debate has now gone on for thirty minutes
councillor
my lord mayor i move under standing order a fifteen b that the vote now be put
i so move lord mayor

seconded lord mayor
in accordance with standing order a thirteen little c this motion will stand referred to the social services committee for consideration and report unless the council decided to deal with it at this meeting
what are the council's wishes
that the council deal with it at this meeting
those in favour
unanimous
councillor
i think i ought to remind you all of us the three basic principles of the national health service
one that is should be free at the point of service
two that treatment offered should be on a basis of need and not ability to pay and thirdly that it should be a comprehensive service for all people whatever background they come from
that's something that i strongly support and my party does and i believe a vast majority of the country support
there's been much debate recently about whether the tories are going to UNK the health service in the future
i think it's actually a waste of time discussing that because they are already UNK the health service
free at the point of service
one in nine of the operations carried out in the region now are done privately and that's actually one in three in some parts of
that's not free at the point of service
private hospitals are actually gonna charge women from outside sixty pounds for UNK screening
i think that's disgusting and certainly it's not free at the point of service
the government to introduce charges for eye tests and since then three million less eye tests have been carried out
short term cuts long term misery and more problems for the health service
that's not free at the point of service
what about treatment on the basis of need
UNK in are being told to do less emergency operations because of the extra costs involved and in UNK are ordered to give priority to patients who come from g p budget holders because there's more money coming from those budget holders nothing to do with basis of need
a comprehensive service
you look at they've transferred all their long term n h s care for the elderly to private nursing homes
where's the power to choose for those elderly people that want free at the point of service national health service treatment
it was or it has been a belief that the n h s was for all of us from the UNK to the grave
it's now a sick joke in the health service it's from the UNK to the UNK
the trusts are in serious financial difficulties and may well be one million pound or two million pound in debt before the end of this financial year
and quite rightly it's gonna be the subject of a parliamentary health select committee enquiry which starts next week
meanwhile it's chief executive it's brains it's driving force is getting out
he says quote there's UNK business for the trust but not for me
and he's so desperate to get out he'll take a twenty thousand pound a year pay cut
he's obviously UNK the UNK ship cos he knows what's happening to it
now what effect is that gonna have on the staff who can't leave
having said that three hundred are been forced to leave three hundred are being sacked as we've heard before
nurses are actually being sacked at
the official term is released not sacked released made redundant
but that's been consistent because there are three thousand less nurses this year in the n h s than there were last year
i don't believe that's because people are being treated better or more people are being treated better but at a cost of eighty million pound there are four thousand more managers or accountants people brought in
under labour it was cut by five percent
doctors pay is up thirty nine percent after inflation under labour it was cut by seventeen percent
the party that are the UNK of the health service
just over one million additional hospital cases were treated in UNK compared with seventy eight
the number of in patients treated has increased by one point two million
waiting lists have risen as councillor has already said under every labour government and fallen under every conservative government since the n h s was founded
that is fact
that is fact
it's ten o'clock
that is fact lord mayor and these facts will bear out
i challenge councillor to bring me the evidence saying otherwise
so
if it's doing so well oh and you wouldn't have been on that long under a labour government of course it would've been jobs for the boys UNK slipped you in i'm sure
so why do the conservatives want to make changes then if we've got such a good record on health
the answer as we have always said is that there are always ways of improving services in addition to putting more money in
this is where we differ from the labour party whose answer is always more money more money more money
the conservative philosophy is not just to increase spending
let's be more efficient and make the tax UNK money be used UNK
let's take a look at the changes the trusts under n h s trusts staff can adapt their services more easily to suit the needs of local people
i thought this was what some of your policy was supposed to be all about
they can decide their own management and staffing structures capital programmes and pay and conditions except those of junior doctors
there is nothing unusual in the idea of hospitals managing themselves
it was only in UNK that teaching hospitals were brought under health authority control
although trusts only came into operation in april ninety one the evidence suggests that many that many have improved patient services in many w many areas waiting lists have been cut through greater efficiency and increased use of day surgery
the organisation and company produced a report on n h s trusts based on discussions with nearly sixty percent of the chief execs of the first wave
it said the key finding of the survey is that an overwhelming majority of the trusts are reporting an improved performance
on the eighteenth of august the sunday times published a survey of twenty five of the biggest trust hospitals
it concluded more patients were being treated and waiting times had been cut
so what of labour's scare tactics of privatisation
i'll quote you from the daily telegraph
that totally just like the t and a that totally UNK paper
lie is a nasty word
lie is a nasty word and those in politics ten who use it tend to get hit by it on the UNK
labour has been saying something it knows to be UNK
this is mister UNK words that the tories will UNK the health service
that seems to me to qualify as a false statement made with the intention of UNK which is how the dictionary defines a lie
the labour party pose as the guardian of the n h s but when pressed they've not policies only empty promises no idea where the funding would come fo from to pay for their ill thought out UNK
robin cook that great man the opposition of the opposition an immediate well then let me quote ya let me quote ya
i'm pleased it's flavour of the month because it's just going to show you all when w when you listen to his words
an immediate halt to the government's hospital trust programme and a long term commitment to restore n h s funding was promised yesterday by robin cook
but mister cook health spokesman declined to say how much extra money he thought the n h s needed or the amount the future labour chancellor would be prepared to find
an immediate halt to the government's hospital trust sorry i'm reading the same thing again
the n h s will not be UNK under conservatives it will UNK from the reforms taking place
finally lord mayor i believe everything i've said
i believe that the labour party know this is a lie
councillor has put this motion in
no it's your policy that if you tell the lie often enough people believe it
councillor well we'll find out councillor has put this motion in i've wound it up lord mayor i'll challenge him or any of his team to a public debate where we can look at the record about name your place name your time i will i will debate with you in public councillor on our record of reforms and the health service
in return you must promise council or that you will outline to the people of the labour party's plans for the n h s and state where you will get the funding from
it's time to put up or shut up councillor
my lord mayor i move under standing order a fifteen b that the vote now be put

what are the council's wishes
i propose it be debated at this meeting lord mayor
seconded
seconded lord mayor
all those in favour
yes ok
councillor
i haven't started i haven't started yet just let me get it out my system
are ya are ya settled now
are you settled
are you settled
right
UNK le mayor
UNK
my lord mayor in case you hadn't noticed foreign languages
but not foreign languages that are not new to
there's a serious a serious side lord mayor to that UNK cos i just looked at the number of companies that are owned this shareholders scheme that they like to promote the number of companies that're owned by foreign UNK
of owned by the UNK owned by the germans owned by german a large number of companies under foreign ownership
one reason one major reason why got to play a pa a role in europe to po protect the interests of the work force within and i make no apologies for any of the visits that any of our members have been on because they've all been worthwhile
and you know tonight i wanted to i wanted to have a knock about with my old UNK partner but he's ill he's very ill from what i've heard tonight and he should go see a doctor
because councillor don't take my advice tonight and i never thought i'd be UNK to but take advantage of what says what you should do
something about UNK i don't understand that
but the euro cities and the position of in europe is of tremendous importance because of the failure of your government to recognise the needs of this district and the UNK needs of this region
we've heard so UNK said by many of my comrades tonight about the problems right across the sectors affecting and i congratulate each and every one on their contribution tonight
we're not gonna waste time explaining things to you and fortunately through our friends through out friends in the t and a we don't have to waste time
the message gets out
there's many factors many factors and i'd like to pay congratulations to councillor i think it was or the member certainly that came to the economic er sub committee that discussed the european report back because there we did have a proper discussion about the value of those trips
but for those that weren't there let me explains some of the good reasons why we're involved
evidence of the european commission experts that strategic alliance between cities are likely to form the basis of future business links
action endorsed by our own chamber of commerce and by our own business leaders in this city on the visits that we took place
previous track record in europe and councillor you can't have it both ways
you claim on the one hand how wonderful you were in securing grants for under the i d o you actually sold this city short because you went for the i d o without making sure that your government paid the extra money that UNK that UNK
that UNK social services education and housing
you know it's true
the first visit to brussels the amend the first visit to brussels we had to go and bail you out because the commission the commission we could have been in this er
the commission were gonna pull the plug on because of your failure while you were in control to UNK to the programme
here
to UNK to the programme because the newly UNK the newly UNK water authority and british rail couldn't UNK couldn't afford the finance to put their share in to the grants from brussels
that's what happened so that's a reality
you're a wonderful s you're a wonderful speaker but wait til i've finished
right
the position on euro cities also is that we and unfortunately are the leading european cities that are involved in promoting good initiatives on the expertise of what exists within be it economic development be it equal opportunities policies we are promoting this city and the benefit of getting those grants and having those UNK of putting officers into brussels means that is being invited by other cities within europe and eastern europe to develop links based on what our expertise is
because the difference between us and the tories is when we mean we support for eastern europe we don't just talk about it UNK we go there and we do it because we see the future of europe being the future of our own people here in
sixty million pounds this council has got out of europe
the costs of the trips
brussels related the cost of the trips less than one percent
a nonsense view to attack that
but then listening to what you've been attacking tonight i'm very sad really that that's all you've got to offer
a weak tory group that doesn't say anything positive about anything
that has a go an attack about everything because you've been rejected so many times so many times and will continue to be rejected when we get the next election that you're frightened to death to have
opting out of hospitals of the n h s opting skills out of l m s and trying to opt out of europe
i hope you i hope you get better
bye
i didn't realise it were that exciting
going back to what i was saying
opting out of schools opting out of the n h s and trying to opt out of europe but what you forgot is that your leader signed a document that says you can't opt out of europe
you can argue about single currency but you can't opt out of the european single market
and that's a serious side to cos if we in council don't lead the way to the way that we're trying through the euro cities by offering what's good in to europe developing those links so that we can share them with the community here and other cultural links then we're doing a dis service
we've got a grant of sixty million
we're able to UNK further revenue out of brussels with the support of the private sector
and they're not having a go they're not having a go they're saying what can we do to assist
can we go with ya
they're talking about going with us certainly but they're doing it in a positive way because they see what the future is
you're trying to shut your eyes to UNK that's what you're trying to do and you're trying to pull the rest of us down with it well it ain't gonna happen
the next steps cos we aren't gonna be frightened by your UNK threats about y'know UNK etcetera
it's no fun for me to be away from my family away from home
it's no fun for my colleagues to be away
but what we do what we do is put first do it properly
many european cities many european cities are making great efforts strasbourg brussels UNK leading cities within europe
i'm proud that name's up there
a video was done about european funding
was in there in that video
the fact a small region and we call ourselves a region that's how we got the grants we now see ourselves developing to support our colleagues in and see the need for a strong regional approach which my colleague will mention later
it's important to this city both in a financial way in a cultural way in the development of the human race that we make europe work
you've turned us that route because your government have switched away from what matters from british people that we represent
not from those UNK got the money to choose as my colleagues have said but for those that need to develop and have the opportunity to develop further
i believe that your amendment is typical of the way you've contributed tonight that you're not really sure for certain about what you're saying and why you're saying it
public debates councillor well i'll have any of ya
i'll probably debate anywhere on contribution within europe
any format any format
and then you try to turn the argument about attacks on individuals
public debate is what it's all about
we've had that public debate and we've got the support from the people of for what we're doing within europe
there's a long way to go because many of these companies that we've mentioned are gonna fight fierce competition from europe and we need to assist them
they've not looked hasn't british industry because of the attacks it's been under on what europe has to offer in terms of better training better health and safety etcetera and we need to bring that information to them
i'm sure that er those thinking members that are left within the tory group if there are any thinking members left will realise the benefits of what we're about and will support the future economic strategy that this council needs to adopt
so i have pleasure in putting the record straight
i'm not gonna UNK about politics with the of europe i believe that what we're saying is the right way forward and i hope you'll UNK support our resolution
councillor
the e c's euro citizens initiative
we should ask ourselves are we a country of UNK
and without a doubt our history the commonwealth of nations and business UNK prove this
we can develop in europe only within the guidelines set out by central government a government quite clear that a joining of the attitudes and minds is desirable not federalism
the and their self UNK must be told clearly that we stand for co operation of western style democracy not the old eastern block style of all UNK socialist state with the dead hand of brussels directing policies as moscow did with the u s r freedom of the independent nation and people must UNK
my lord mayor after setting the parameters i do feel that can continue it's good relations with our other cities and use brussels as a tool to this end
yes euro cities is an organisation of brussels but it must not be allowed to dominate the proceedings and massage and manage the cities
it must be free city to city co operation within a loose association with brussels
we have seen the UNK of the e c agriculture programme
this must be avoided in euro cities
euro cities can be a sound tool for co operation and our officers must be at the forefront with the chambers of trade of commerce and development association and all of which have expertise in europe
both agencies that the chief UNK office refers to frequently
however we must ask what of our euro m p's
there seems to be little work from the labour local member
perhaps this is why in addition to officers attending meetings labour councillors need to improve their self UNK by going into europe on UNK
there are issues across europe that we need to be aware of as a city
however we need to UNK financial UNK and only send members occasionally with officers more frequently
we need to liaise with europe as a city but there must be three UNK
one that we ca that we only go when a clear brief from brussels officers cannot be established and not a trip just for the lads which was UNK of the last UNK organised trips
two that we do not become wrapped up in the bureaucratic socialism of brussels and that true UNK spirit is encouraged between cities
and three that financial UNK and co operation with the private sector are adopted for the good of our city
councillor we all remember UNK when labour voted to withdraw from europe and then wanted to re negotiate in UNK
this is the party who are now playing the euro card with UNK
labour are in labour are out or is it now how best can they play to win votes
here
my lord mayor at the economic strategy sub committee meeting recently we were asked to adopt from florence an objective two statement which was not clear and did not translate precisely
it is typical of the controlling group's over enthusiasm for the photo press opportunity that they're anxious to sign anything even if the policies are not clear
with reference to the euro visits in september thirteen trips since last summer to europe
seven labour councillors and twenty three officers cutting twenty three thousand pounds of charge UNK money is totally unnecessary when liaison groups already exist within the chief UNK office the development association and the regional association on which we all have representatives
if labour had supported our idea in it's early stage we would now have spent over seventy percent of the funds available in the five year cycle
here
not the miserable thirty four percent spent at the moment all due to labour slowing down the regeneration of our district by UNK financial support
officers need to UNK information and if visits are necessary they should decide with the chief UNK support the need to visit europe not labour councillors on a UNK costing twenty thousand out of the pockets of our charge payers
we support liaison but not self UNK by labour councillors
even that UNK paper the t and a in the UNK recently stated we cannot afford the UNK of going along just to see the party just to be at the party
councillor must also remember that and other major companies have a overseas branches of their company
it is not just a one way traffic as he tried to er indicate
we have no objection to the principle of a motion on involvement across europe especially following our recent UNK re emergence into democracy as both of us can benefit from future e c funds
however we need to be satisfied that members' visits are essential and we will ensure that the details behind labour's motion are monitored closely
we have officer liaison groups
let them get on with it and use their capabilities to the full
we as members should not sit on their UNK and tell them exactly where to go
that is why we put forward our amendment and hope against all hope that labour may see the light and vote with us on our amendment
thank you lord mayor
councillor
thank you lord mayor
is a european city but not just that is a city that leads in europe
it's a city because of it's rich cultural heritage and it's expertise in local government affairs that has much to offer those emerging local UNK in eastern europe
and yes we can teach them about partnership councillor and i think it's UNK for the tories to talk about links with the private sector
the private sector didn't know where you were for two years
i've got a very interesting quote here
the scale of our achievement is a result of a great deal of hard work on the part of officers and councillors
we had the UNK to assess the situation and successfully sell case
now i could have said that but of course it was councillor
but there is a new situation emerging because the speakers on the opposite side seem to have forgotten what's happened in the last two years in eastern europe and the european map is getting wider
lord mayor i'd like to get beyond the UNK and because i suspect the real reason behind the criticisms of the leader of the opposition is because the chief executive didn't invite him on one or two of these trips because
if the stories of are to be believed and who would doubt him is that the kind of person that wants as an UNK in europe
nobody on this side of the council chamber wants a UNK
like councillor personally i've got better things to do like being at home
but i believe that the decisions made to go on the trips this autumn have been good ones
i would apologise UNK if i thought any of them have been a mistake but i don't believe they have been
any decision that has been made has been with the best intentions of the people of at heart to maintain as a leading european city and to derive benefits for the people of this community
i'd just like to say a few words on the conferences that i attended
the euro cities conference in and this is where the tories fall down on the facts because councillor doesn't really understand what euro cities is about
euro cities is a group of independent cities who're putting pressure on brussels to maintain funding in urban areas after the review of the structural funds in UNK
and because of that pressure the pressure that's already been put on we got good news at
the european commissions director for regional policy said that he'd accepted the submission from euro cities that funding would be made available for urban areas
we need to make sure that pressure stays on because urban areas as we know with the city challenge bid and others have got distinct and unique problems which we need to address
the euro cities conference was also important because it was the founding of that organisation formally and it was important to go there and say to the big UNK that's emerging it's
so what we do is what this er solicitor would have done in relation to it
yes
and it really is covered by the UNK in erm just i just reiterate that UNK referring your lordship to it professional duty except in so far as it may be necessary to UNK the rules that was at page eight hundred and forty one at the bottom and it goes over the page to eight four two and then proceeds to general proposition to those two experts ordinary witness may not may not give their opinions towards matters legal or moral obligation
my lord to say that evidence will not assist you and shouldn't be received
my lord if i could question it
it is not er this evidence does not go to a matter of law er and the duty but it matter of practice and my lord what this case is dealing with is about what if what is or should be the practice of a solicitors engaged in commercial conveyancing as to the advice that is given to clients and er my lord the er commercial conveyancing is obviously a matter which particularly concerns
