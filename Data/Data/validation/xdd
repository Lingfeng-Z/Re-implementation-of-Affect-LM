erm as far as the drop tanks are concerned does that have any impact on the range or are you just talking about the numbers that you will have spare
they're purely on the numbers the same er stand the different sizes would still be available there would merely be fewer of them in total stocks
but would you envisage that the numbers er of aircraft actually UNK out with these things have been reduced or are you talking about having spares in case they get lost or damaged
no the very name as the name implies in many cases we would er UNK the drop tanks before entering combat and er therefore there is an agreed rate at which we would expect to use them so that they are a UNK stock in operations
and in training presumably do you drop them in training or do you not
no not normally no
so it's only operational
yes
and can you give an indication of how quickly these things could be ordered in an emergency
perhaps i can take that one er group captain
once the erm drop tanks have been developed and have entered production in most of the lead time one associates with providing a capability has er has actually been avoided so we could re order probably within a year
very UNK mr gordon i we're not necessarily gonna have a year's warning that we're going to need these aircraft in the event of war
well that of course er may be true but er as the group captain has said here in the reduced er spec position which we now face and judgement was taken as to how much we should invest in stocks of reserve drop tanks at this point and the option exists to order more
can i ask it's absolutely meaningless to me do you mean a month three months nine months eleven months eleven and a half months what do you mean
no what i mean is that er once the item is in production if you wish to order another hundred drop tanks or another thousand drop tanks if you make that order then approximately one year later you would receive deliveries of those tanks against that order
now that would be the normal peacetime lead time if we could UNK that in industry and find some way of doing it then it may well be possible to do in quicker time than that
so in approximately one year you might be fourteen months or fifteen months
i i'm er quoting a hypothetical situation here that we have entered production with er production line for drop tanks maybe producing two three thousand tanks against a projected usage for the next ten years and sometime during that period we decide you want to order an additional thousand tanks two thousand tanks then you could adjust the rate at which the deliveries occur you could adjust the total quantity and with about a years notice industry can get in the materials and produce the goods for you
does that answer your question
if er there was a crisis and there was a need for a rush order er one would be talking of weeks for something that is UNK to start coming off the production line
experience during the UNK war and during gulf war indicated that once an item was in production tremendous acceleration is possible in the real war situation
yes
i was discussing a year for a normal peacetime lead time
presumably drop tanks aren't lost very often in peace time it's operations that you've actually UNK is that right
that is absolutely right correct
UNK george
thank you i do you feel a little UNK at changing operational requirements based on er an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two ninety three which i presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty
so how confident are you that potential UNK will not have the capability in two thousand and twenty to make a mess of our UNK as the UNK would have done during the er the cold war
erm i'm asking this question to e satisfy myself that these changes and reduction in costs are not the result of political UNK as opposed to er a genuine assessment of what the risk in the change environment is likely to be
fine
that is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four UNK of defence staff they were asking that kind of question and i'll now ask the group captain to respond
yes er i think perhaps the point i'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact
well the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel weapons ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is not difficult
peter
my i move to er questions about the er comparison between the erm eurofighter and other fighters it might find itself in combat with
well peter i'm sorry but the notice only said once UNK is meant to lead us into that i'm sorry
right i'm sorry
UNK
when you updated er the combat analysis using the latest data on eurofighter did you again compare er eurofighter with alternatives such as an updated f sixteen or f fifteen er previous combat modelling showed that an alternative aircraft er apart from the f twenty two did not approach the capability of eurofighter
did the latest modelling confirm this and what is the next best alternative in terms of capability
right group captain granville white
yes wh when they reported to the committee two years ago erm i explained that there was combat modelling going on at the time and indeed that was completed by the end of nineteen ninety two and it showed that er of all the alternatives available then eurofighter two thousand was the most cost effective solution to the r a UNK requirements and yet it would it would not be able to meet up er to the f twenty two but other than that it was superior to all other aircraft
at the moment erm because of the extra time we've got available because production investment has been delayed because of UNK decisions we've set in train three further studies and they will look collectively at alternatives comparison in combat modelling and also in the numbers and if i could describe those three very briefly because i think they're the they're relevant to what we're talking about
the two initially there are two studies which will look into numbers one of those is a top downs study which is based on UNK and will look at erm a variety of different situations around the world from an UNK point of view
the second one is erm a bottom up study which is based on today's commitments but UNK them forward into the timescale in which we will have the aircraft and looking in that way to see how many and in what way we would need them
the third one focusing in specifically on the combat modelling is what is known as a c o e i a which is a combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisal and this work is being carried out at UNK and we're comparing in single roles and multi role eurofighter two thousand against different aircraft
so for example in the specialist air defence er side we're looking at alternatives would be the f twenty two erm the current tornado f three and also an UNK of the f three
in the ground attack side we're comparing it to the jaguar that it'll replace the UNK g r seven and also the tornado g r four and then in the multi role arena for air defence air UNK and attack we're comparing our aircraft against the french UNK the american f eighteen e which is the future UNK of the f eighteen the f fifteen e the multi role but primarily air to surface machine and also the f sixteen c those are the ones we're currently looking at
as the cost of eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the f twenty two i it becomes UNK and by how much would the performance of eurofighter have to be UNK before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative
i wonder if i could answer that in a in a different way because clearly rather there's the option rather than reduction the operational capability which was really the er initiative that had begun in nineteen ninety two there is the option of course of er UNK the total numbers and that would er have an overall bearing on the total programme cost but UNK because certainly the judgement of the er the UNK of staff was that er as far as the u k was concerned then we should retain the operational capability as i explained earlier an n and not decrease it in any significant extent because if we did that then we could end up er with an inferior capability against a potential threat
during the last year erm when we were working on the requirement we carried out a number of erm UNK or aircraft in various respects
for example taking out the forward looking infra red infra red search and track taking out the m i d s the multiple information distribution system and certain aspects of the er defensive aids to see what impact that would have and we found that if we removed any one of those erm then we would either come down to UNK against potential threat or possibly er UNK and that was really the supporting evidence to retain the full capability
but group captain are you saying that as er a platform it has not been UNK at all there's basically no change in thrust in turn rate or in UNK g loading
yes that's correct
thank you
peter was your question answered or not
no in the air UNK role i didn't hear a comparison with the s u thirty five or the UNK m e twenty nine s er are there any other aircraft of er perhaps comparable capacity with which you did not compare eurofighter
what we've done won one of the points i think that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the russians exporting all over the place but clearly er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to in comparing er our aircraft against other western ones we've also looked at them as potential threats because it's possible that er erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those
but the question that young pilots would want to know the answer to is this erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air UNK
no there are none
so you have compared with the
and the s u
yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned the s u thirty five and the which is an UNK s u twenty seven and the m i g twenty nine s yes we've specifically compared against those two
and you've been UNK by the responses
yes
thank you chairman
thank you michael UNK
yes mr chairman i'm not clear erm about something that mr gordon said in his opening remarks that i'd like clarified and that is that he gave the committee the impression that there were er certain of the of the partners that were accepting erm a lower specification in other words UNK from the what is the british best if you like erm certain items of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft both in development stage and at the production stage final cost of the aircraft unit cost
erm we asked the question about the UNK reduced operational capabilities as far as britain is concerned we were told that there was no reduction erm there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries i mean which countries are asking for what to be omitted and by how much is the percentage in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that picking up something that wing com er group captain granville white has just mentioned which i is the question of sales
yes
erm it does obviously have a bearing on sales to the third countries when the er aircraft is in production
do i get the impression that we're basically building a basic aircraft with optional extras or are we building an aircraft which can be to some degree UNK because obviously there are some parts of the specification of the aircraft we may not wish third UNK countries to have
it's a well known fact that aircraft are sold all around the world this can have a bearing on the capability and also a bearing on their cost and therefore UNK
perhaps from those remarks it's hardly a question but perhaps you could just clarify
yes
my er thinking on the on what you said in opening remarks which don't make it clear to me whether we've got a basic aircraft with optional extras or a fully specified aircraft from which we can UNK deleted certain items of equipment
erm well i think i can reassure that it is the latter
the development programme for the aircraft will provide the broad range of capabilities which was asked for by all four nations originally and er the fact that one or more nations may have deleted its requirement for a particular facility doesn't remove the need for us to complete the development work er because we still have at least one or two customers for that facility
so it's definitely the latter we are developing a fully capable eurofighter two thousand aircraft and if erm any of our four participating nations do not want a particular facility then we will make provision for them to leave that out in production and if an export customer does not require the full range of capabilities we can also remove them for that export customer
but by how much could we UNK the aircraft and still be capable of erm competing with erm other aircraft in the market
well i would prefer to perhaps follow this one up in the closed session later but erm
we we'll pursue that er in private
UNK
going to go into service in the next century it's going to be around till well into the next century
very briefly what would it do that the present generation of aircraft won't how is it a UNK leap ahead
fine i will again invite the group captain to answer that
perhaps i could er answer that in er i think there are probably four points that er come out to my mind erm the first one in the UNK engine combination a very high degree of UNK
the ability to be able to pull nine g which is er generally accepted to be the physiological limit for pilots which is more than any of our aircraft can
what can we do now by contrast
er none of our aircraft can pull more than seven g normal aircraft
there's also a close correlation by not just the erm the size of the number for g but how long can it go on pulling that g given the thrust and the UNK capabilities of the machine and we are essentially building this aircraft so that it can sustain nine g and we are providing the pilot with the sort of equipment he requires to be able to survive in that kind of environment
is this for a dog fight
yes
th it has er a considerable negative g capability as well
would it be able er pulling that erm g to compete with the with the UNK using the technique
erm group captain granville white
the simple answer is yes
er so i think the first of my four points is the is the UNK clearly the ability to m manoeuvre
the second erm is and perhaps is related in a way er in the air to air weapons where erm in older missiles have had what is known as sort of bore sight capability where they go in the direction of the aircraft
clearly to have the combination of an off bore sight capability for a missile such as a s r a m the er advance short range air to air missile the combination of the UNK of the weapon and the flat platform together has been shown to be really needed you can't have one without the other and that somebody who has only UNK in the aircraft or UNK in the in the weapon will lose against somebody who has it in both
so i think that's the probably the sort of related point
moving on into the sort of UNK and the electronics side erm for UNK erm the defensive aid sub system will be er very complex very sophisticated but also integrated so that it has a complete system of protection for the aircraft erm an and finally moving on the sort of electronics side then clearly with different UNK such as the UNK the forward looking infra red infra red search and track the er multiple information distribution system and also certain aspects of the er electronic UNK suite then by having UNK which enables the best information at any one time to be correlated into the system as a whole then that will provide a very good capability and far in excess of anything that we have at the moment
thank you very much
i'll ask UNK to take us on into the question of the role of this aircraft
we understand that some new weapons not previously in the specification are to be included
are you able to tell us in open session what sort of weapons are envisaged
erm perhaps i can invite my colleague from the office of management and budgets to speak to that one
erm chairman yes we hope to erm excuse me to erm that e four will be capable of er sorry e f two thousand will be capable of handling all our erm planned weapons er which are already in our programme the er conventional er the c a s o m the UNK armed stand off missile the er anti UNK missile er twelve thirty eight and the future medium range air to air missile er whatever that happens to be er as a result of er competition
what about the low level laser guided bomb is that also included in this
yes it is
erm does the fact of erm using the aircraft to er provide a platform for these systems er tell us something about a change in view about the role or operating concept of the aircraft
erm group captain granville white
thank you erm not change erm with UNK
widen
wi certainly UNK we've envisaged from the outset that the aircraft would be both will be multi role capable and that erm all that the primary design driver will be the air to air UNK role but the air to surface role would be almost an equal clearly one has to have a UNK and those particular weapons in the air to surface side the conventional armed stand off missile along the low level er low level laser guided bomb and the future anti UNK weapon they clearly erm really take the UNK side into the next century
we will still have the ability to carry today's weapons such as the l seven five cluster bomb unit the thousand pound bomb erm and the c r v seven rocket and things like that but clearly as we move forward into the century it's important that as the platform UNK then so does the aircraft
are the any weapons er which the aircraft er would not be able to for example the j p two three closely associated with the tornado er is that a system which you would anticipate eurofighter two thousand to be able to carry
no it it's too large and too heavy and really that is a different role that's more the role for the tornado g l one g l four
and i think you mentioned thousand pounds bombs
yes
is that the is that the limit could anything heavier than that
it's no it's not the limit er the limit of weight it can carry er heavier ones
you may not wish to say in open session
i think probably as you
in closed session
yes it's probably more appropriate
erm i was rather interested by the UNK which you explained a little earlier in the evidence erm if you've got an aircraft which is er going to replace as i understand it the jaguar and the UNK which has already been retired er against which you've been comparing the f three er and the g r four of the UNK and the UNK then er that gives rise in my mind to the possibility that this is an aircraft which might replace all of these in which case will that have consequences for the still er publicly declared intention to order two hundred and fifty might we order more for example
mr evans
erm as you say mr UNK er the plan at the moment is that the f two thousand will replace jaguar and the tornado a d v f three aircraft and the scope er of replacing other aircraft er remains under consideration er provisional off take of two fifty er was declared at the d the start of the development phase and of course our work share in development is based on that number
before we seek authorisation for the production phase it will be necessary for each nation to UNK or modify it's planned off take and that will be done very firmly on the basis of the studies which er group captain granville white has already d described which will factor in er against our military tasks which is y you know we define now fairly clearly er exactly what aircraft are needed to undertake those tasks in what UNK and in the future er as you say there may well be scope for er adding additional aircraft types to that
well i think i understand that answer to be an UNK that if this aircraft is capable of replacing if you like the suite of aircraft we've been discussing then er that may well result in orders for more than two hundred fifty
it could do because obviously there are a number of other considerations not least UNK er within the defence programme which erm from my point of view is a very important consideration
but of course if one wants to continue to have the capability into the next century which the present er range of aircraft provides er then eurofighter two thousand may be the only available platform for those purposes
indeed and i think the er the point about eurofighter is that it's a very flexible er aircraft it's a multi role aircraft it's a cost effective aircraft and therefore it er as you say may well be able to cover quite a large spectrum
can i ask you about er the medium range surface to air missile because er you won't be surprised to learn that er the committee's received a number of submissions on this matter er which suggest that er t to proceed with eurofighter two thousand without the medium range surface to air missile er i mean to be put rather UNK to us that it makes little sense to proceed with the aircraft without a replacement for blood hound
what's your response to that
well i think perhaps i can start that and the group captain may want to come in
er i think our position is that we provide as you know air defence through a UNK system er of air defence aircraft and missiles and the simple truth is that in the light of the changes in the strategic er setting particularly er as it affects u k air defence we have decided that the provision of a medium defensive layer that is the m sound system to which you refer is not a high priority at the moment and the programme is therefore being UNK and i have to emphasise it's not been abandoned
well erm if i were then to ask you when what was your best estimate to when the programme was likely to be commenced
i fancy you would not be able to give me any more precise an answer than one you've just given isn't that right
well UNK tend not to be precise in this in this kind of er context er mr UNK
but certainly we er as i said the essential point is that we are looking at the capability across the board and taking into account the strategic requirement as we see it in terms of the direct threat to the u k in particular which is obviously dramatically declined as a result of the collapse of the UNK
we believe that certainly for the time being the combination of the fighter aircraft and UNK will provide an acceptable level er of air defence with a much reduced air threat to the u k er which now exists
we will continue to look at er the future programme er we will also as you know look at UNK missile defence which is another element to this and that must need to be fact UNK in as well but i think clearly we are not talking about in the medium term er and longer term we are talking about er a fairly late stage of the programme
i mean how do you protect eurofighter two thousand in the absence of the medium range surface to air missile on the i think you told us about er the aircraft themselves as it were providing their own protection but what else
well as i've said we have as you say y yourself you have the aircraft itself you have the er the existing er air defence aircraft you have UNK and in our view er in certainly in terms of the u k's threat er that is er an acceptable er suite of preventative measures in the light of the threat which we now have
i think i have to make the point to you that we are planning to roughly double the size of the er UNK equipment programme er between now and the end of the century a very substantial chunk of that is e f two thousand and its er associated weapon systems and you know one has to frankly take er a view on priorities er in the light of the strategic requirement and given the er extent of the threat as we see it the possibility of using er of taking part in out of area operations in UNK that kind of thing that was the judgement we took er the medium term priorities were such that we couldn't afford the first er stage of a m s a m
w was that decision to any extent er influenced by if i can put it rather er UNK the state of blood hound when it was taken out of service
well as you know i think the committee looked at this erm in nineteen ninety one and er i think it is fairly true to say that by the time it was taken out of service blood hound did not represent a very high level of capability erm and the gap there is a gap obviously between blood hound it'll now be a rather longer gap between that and any a m s a m replacement er but blood hound itself was judged to be frankly not worth having
i remember mr alan clarke who was then minister of responsibility saying rather UNK in the house of commons that the removal of blood hound did nothing to UNK britain's air defence
i would not wish to disagree with mr clarke
well i wouldn't offer that as a general er proposition
neither would i actually in this particular case
perhaps we should UNK it to the UNK we're talking
one last matter please erm so far as i understand that you've not yet drafted the separate staff requirement for UNK i beg you pardon UNK equipment for eurofighter two thousand
are you able to tell us what the timescale of that is
perhaps i can ask group captain
yes
of the four nations in the programme the u k is the only one that has a requirement for UNK
erm and at the moment we are carrying out some studies which er are UNK completion to decided exactly what the r a UNK future requirements are for tactical UNK
as that work comes to er UNK the staff target will be drafted and in fact work is already begun on that erm but because the UNK capability won't be required until fairly late in the replacement programme then there is no particular hurry to get on with the work
what we hope to be able to do is to complete the requirement the staff target this year and set in train some industrial studies to see what the various options are and then once we enter the production investment phase then that would be the time that we would er look to doing the development work
are these costs included in the overall estimates which have been given to us f for the UNK
UNK
er yes indeed they are
they are many thanks thank you
UNK
from what you've told us it would be possible for this aircraft to be so multi mission it could replace the whole of the front line er r a f fast UNK strain could that be true
group captain
i think the point i would i wish to make is that in whilst er its multi role capability would have enabled it to replace a number of roles and possibly a number of er aircraft and er as mr evans said earlier that's still being looked at
the one role that it won't be able to carry out is as we were talking earlier about the er j p two three runway UNK weapon and also er nuclear
so that those two roles er clearly cannot be covered by it
i was also thinking o of UNK and er the weapons going on and the mistakes anyway on the developing a UNK replacement is the r a f still interested in that as a feature a short take off vertical take off
i think the r a f would clearly be interested in keeping in touch with what's going on there of course the states themselves er the picture is not entirely clear er about er what kind of types are going to emerge in the longer term but we would certainly wish to keep a close view on what was going on and of course there is a navy dimension to the UNK replacement as well
coming back to what you said about the load carrier we are supposed to no longer be in the nuclear game in the UNK isn't that right coming out of the nuclear role
so that would no longer be a consideration
i think i think erm it's a question mr UNK it's the long range UNK i think which erm is the distinction it's the ability to get through low level longer range and carrying greater level of UNK than either
wh what about er runway lengths obviously depends on what it's carrying but er how does it compare with existing aircraft for that
erm it's very much shorter because as we were saying earlier on the short take off and landing capability erm with er i'd prefer to talk about distances perhaps in the closed session but the er the simple answer is very much
only one crew member with all the technology in the world some of us still think that it's a comfort to have somebody in the back watching the systems
well that particular subject of course is er still a matter which is discussed with great heat er in the crew rooms all over the royal air force
especially the UNK
exactly and er we are buying er a two seat version of this aeroplane er our two seat version is aimed primarily at operational training but er we have examined er time and again whether we believe the er the integration of the UNK which is possible in this aeroplane and which is planned for this aeroplane er is going to be able to reduce the pilot work load to such an extent that one man can UNK do the job and we have arrived at the conclusion that he most certainly can
the er work which has UNK at er british aerospace in the UNK to bring together all the information displays and controls erm has been tested on er a team of eighteen pilots from drawn from the four nations to see whether they believe they can cope with that sort of pilot work load in UNK operations and they're content that this kind of UNK is ideally suited for the task and they can cope
so we are convinced that it is er a cheap one
what about spare aircraft
do you set out the sum er you must set out some calculation of how many you are likely to lose over the life of the aircraft is there a percentage figure you could give us for that
erm mr evans er will reply to that obviously we do plan for certain levels
yes i think it's fair to say at the moment that is being looked at mr UNK together with er the broader range of issues on the er the operating concept er for e f two thousand but it is of course standard practice to buy not just the number you need for the front line but to buy sufficient aircraft to keep that front line in field for about twenty five thirty years whatever the life of the aircraft happens to be taking account of er UNK taking account of training requirements and engineering needs and support needs and all that kind of thing and all that work er is has been done is being done at the moment and er final figures will be put to that in due course
thank you mr UNK
mr erm bearing in mind it its multi role capability and the fact that the u k is likely to be engaged in more and more out of air operations in support of u n er has any consideration been given to a UNK
would that be er a practical thing to do or would you have to start UNK a new aircraft
er by UNK do you
i mean from air to fly from aircraft carriers
the short answer is no
not at this stage
is that because of technical difficulties or for some other reason
erm er it's basically that there is no stated requirement at present from any of the four nations for this aircraft to operate on ships er back in the early days of the programme when the french were involved er we looked at the possibility of designing an aircraft er to provide the whole spectrum of capabilities from air defence er ground attack and also UNK operations off ships and er we certainly experienced some difficulties in UNK all those things in one design which was adequately capable in each of the areas
thank you UNK
there's an ambiguity i suspect it it's a in my mind rather than yours about the nuclear role did i understand you to say that eurofighter two thousand would not have the capability of carrying for instance the w e one seven we know that the is not going to be er taken any further according to recent announcement but will eurofighter two thousand have the capacity to carry w e one seven
no that demonstrated the point i was making it will not
so it in the absence of the UNK and in the absence of the capability then it's not gonna have a nuclear role
no
thank you very much
UNK
would there not be merits er at least putting in the UNK wiring in case at a future date that a c a s o m for instance became dual capable
er perhaps i could make er one comment maybe mr gordon will ma wish to make a technical comment on it but certainly when we began the programme and we discussed with the other nations in the early stages of the UNK
erm it was really one of the guidelines it was the if we considered doing that then i don't think we would have had a four nation programme or certainly a five nation programme at the start i don't think we would've er stayed together it was really one of the basic requirements not to have that capability
but is it not an add on capability er to a large degree if the basic wiring is there
i think we'd find mr UNK that it it's rather more complex than that and the requirements for delivering a nuclear weapon and you refer to the possibility of c a s o m being nuclear capable one has to be fairly careful quite a there's a degree of difference between a missile needed to do the two jobs and i think it would be rather more than wiring which would be er at issue here there's the UNK and all the rest of it which i suspect would cause very severe problems with that
er well we always start from what does the operator of this aircraft want to use it for
this e s r d really is the bible and we have specified the aircraft to meet that e s r d and not anything extra er obviously if one of the four nations wants to build a nuclear role into the aircraft that becomes a very big political question first and foremost and we have just not considered it at the technical level at all because it's er it's not in the requirement
is it a big technical problem or is it very straight forward
er i don't think i'd wish to speculate in open forum
it doesn't require a great bite of imagination to see that the germans for example would have been extremely reluctant to have been involved in a four nation project with a nuclear capability available as part of it
well i wouldn't er pin point the german attitude on this one i mean after all we did UNK with germany very successfully on the tornado which has a nuclear role but the four governments must first of all decide if that is what we want to build into this aeroplane and they decided that they did not at that stage
i stand corrected
fine
if i just er end this particular item in two brief questions
from what you said about UNK equipment it rather sounds to me as if the tornado d r one a is likely to be replaced by in this UNK role
is that right
i think as a group captain er explained y'know the operational staff have really got to complete their study into what kind of tactical UNK capability they want in the next century
the d r one a is currently an excellent er tactical UNK aircraft all weather at night etcetera and er it will go on well into the next century so there's no great hurry to make a decision er one of the first points has gotta be decided is whether we carry the UNK equipment in a UNK under the aircraft replacing some of the other weapons or whether we try to build it in and er but taking first things first we have to get the requirement sorted out
thank you and as far as the UNK concerned i noted that the jaguar is not being UNK out now until two thousand and four that being a three year further delay
is that related to the delay in production dates
erm mr evans
er no i don't think it is mr chairman
and do we know what the reasoning behind it is
well we do or we'd it had already been envisaged that er the UNK would run out at er roughly that time
i think it was three years earlier though wasn't it
well er the i mean there has been a slight complexity with the replacement er programme of course because er e f two thousand was originally envisaged that it would replace the UNK er as well as the UNK and now that er has altered with the decision in options to er get rid of er the UNK we've er been able to adjust the replacement programme such that er the aircraft e f two thousand will replace er the erm er the jaguar and some of the f threes er and the programme will be adjusted such that we get er the most cost effective er mixture of replacement of those two types and there is no problem with keeping the jaguar going until that stage and it may well be it is being judged to be cheaper that we should er do some f three replacement at the same time again partly for cost reasons because it's gonna be more cost effective to do it that way
like the jaguar really be able to go on that long given er that er there's an awful lot of errors in the gulf apart from anything else
well obviously that factor er was considered carefully by the ministry of defence before our secretary of state agreed that we could safely defer the in service date for eurofighter two thousand and adjust the er replacement plan er back in december ninety two so we have looked at what is the current rate of consumption of UNK life on the jaguar er what can be done economically and sensibly to keep it flying safely and effectively into the next century and er we have come to the conclusion that we have a viable plan here which can tie up with the planned rate of delivery to service of eurofighter two thousand
so are you gonna have to restrict training in er operational flights jaguar at a stretch just to stretch out the hours
we understand that is not necessary but erm my colleague may wish to
no
but it does sound from what you're telling us now that it is actually directly related and to recall my original question was it related to programme to which i had the answer no erm what you said
well i apologise we're not trying to mislead you er mr chairman in any way
clearly there is a connection if eurofighter two thousand was available earlier then they the plan for replacing er some of the aircraft in the r a UNK front line er could be adjusted accordingly erm but it's not a sort of direct one for one er if the part of the programme slips a year the jaguar must go on an extra year because within the r a UNK overall plans for its er fleet replacement there is a certain degree of flexibility an and precisely which point the UNK get replaced is er a judgement between them and their three
i think i know what you mean anyway thank you
UNK
two er requirements for the future that er seem to be er desirable are UNK and what could be UNK than the present generation of aircraft and secondly to prevent you having to go over your target you're likely to be shot down so that you need a stand up weapon capability er if the UNK is somewhat limited can it still carry stand off weapons that are effective
er group captain
those yes
erm perhaps i could would it i wonder if you could just expand on UNK exactly what the er
have actually already covered them another time and i don't want to get deeper in the UNK now than that there's a limit on the time now available this morning
can we deal with the weapon question the stand off weapons
i can answer that very briefly mr chairman er yes there will be the capability to carry stand off weapons the UNK armed stand off missile for example will have a good stand off range
that will be carried by
that will be carried and er with a shorter range but the advanced anti UNK weapon that will also have a stand off capability and that will also be carried
go on into the development timescale and costs
yes it's now going to take two years longer i think than was originally er UNK to what extent is this due to technical difficulties and to what extent is it due to one of our partners and germany one's thinking of in particular wishing to slow the programme down for UNK reasons
well erm it's a combination of both those factors er as i've mentioned at the outset the development programme has moved ahead a little more slowly than we would wish the main reasons for this were associated firstly with the delay in selecting equipment er and that took longer than our contractor ha had imagined
secondly the deliveries of the equipment from the equipment suppliers who had been selected er generally fell behind the promises which they had made so the main reason for the technical delays has been lack of equipment of the correct standard to proceed with the integration programme erm the erm the problems which UNK the programme in nineteen ninety two after the german minister started questioning its future clearly had a direct bearing on that because many of the equipment suppliers particularly those in germany suddenly began to think hey this programme is not going anywhere why should we invest a lot of effort and money into it and they UNK down so that has had a knock on effect in terms of UNK the total programme and erm the result of all of that has been that the current development programme schedule which we have supplied to the committee is probably about as fast as the programme is capable of running
first flight still going to be in april
we are confident it will be in april yes
and will that aircraft be less capable in its first flight than you'd originally hoped
erm it has always been planned that the this er release of the flight control system will be UNK through five steps and the capabilities at first flight are more or less what we had been planning er right from the outset
the cost is going to be some three thousand four hundred million i think to er to the u k that's er gone up by about thirteen percent four hundred million roughly er over the original estimates half of that is due to programme re orientation because of the extension of the programme by two years as i understand it
can you spell out what those costs are and are we having to pay more because germany wants to slow the programme down
perhaps i can ask mr perry to er fill in the details on costs
yes
erm mr UNK er that er UNK of the four hundred and fifty million between er the effect of programme re orientation and other factors
can i just say that i had UNK four hundred million it is in fact four fifty
four fifty million sorry
four fifty million erm between programme re orientation and other factors was an UNK we made back in the er first half of nineteen ninety three and in the light of later information i think we would revise that now erm we are still negotiating with the contractors on the revised contract price and we do not have definitive costs yet but in fact the cost increase as a result of the UNK of the programme directly should be quite modest
there are some UNK costs er on that count particularly on the engine programme where delays to the aircraft programme which results in extra costs on the engine side are the customer's liability
erm but the main increase in cost is actually in the equipment area and results i think from the fact that the equipment prices turned out to be higher than was originally estimated at the start of the programme and also the fact that u k industry won a higher work share on equipment than we had originally been entitled to and budgeted for and lastly the point you mentioned that germany has withdrawn from some parts of the requirement and that made certain UNK non common and we have had to take a larger share of the cost of those UNK than originally planned
okay can you spell out how our share of the cost has increased because our share of the work has increase
i thought that presumably the bill was still divided UNK between the countries
no the bills are met by er on the UNK funding basis so basically we pay for the work done in the u k
from which we will get the benefit presumably when production starts
in er general terms whether the production work sharing is
with it just there
yes
oh have you got a pen
oh i see
yeah carry on
whoever UNK to this first off anyway
right we've done it
so erm
what we've done is print our names in capital letters there
so you want my name printed there
yes please
right
thirty five
of course yeah
that's how old i am next week
it's only a approximate estimate
well i'm only trying to find just a few more recordings for her because they're coming towards the end of the er
of the contract and er
and you're welcome to keep that if you like
if that's of any interest to you
yeah
erm yeah er that'd be quite interesting have a read through thank you
it's a fascinating project
now over to you
and it was a vertical blind we were
that's right it's this window
yes it was for this window
mm
right
have you any UNK particular colour in mind
well i would
we've never ever looked at vertical blinds before
have we
white
i think white actually is the best colour because it yeah anything else i think is going to be
well this is the book
and erm all the different erm UNK
mm
are colour UNK so as you can
yeah
see all the white one are at the front and they're
mm
they're all classed as white but you can see some are
but some are more cream aren't they yeah
i think i want a really a as white a white as
do you want to come up to the window where you can see
as possible cos e everything in the background is white
if i move this out of the way cos you'll need to get at sorry
the dogs
poor dog can see the rabbit now
so erm in addition to these erm UNK here right at the back of the book
mhm
there's a couple more sections where erm we've got these are some of the later UNK which were added on
as you can see th those are white probably look a
aha
bit more fancy that the standard ones
yeah
okay
can i leave you to erm have a UNK at that while i measure the door
mm
mm
yeah fine
what we're really essentially interested in i think is keeping the sun which tends to be very strong from there
yes
when it's a nice sunny day out
so what we're looking for is one that will UNK go erm
yes
to that angle
right
and
so we go through o er one hundred and eighty degrees
oh they go complete through
so from
yeah
from being at this angle where you're looking directly
yeah
through it they go all the way to the closed position that way
yeah
and the other way as well
ah
oh they do both
oh th that's wonderful
yes
that's brilliant yes
as i say we know nothing about them at all we've never ever owned one
however i think erm y you're one the right track erm picking white out
mm
because
it is going to reflect the
yes
the light yes
i've got erm i'll show the type of thing i've got
yes
it's not it's not actually in here but i've got erm perhaps that kind of colour
mm
with more that sort of fabric
a gen
erm
a UNK
yes but a similar to that but a little bit UNK
mm
and in the middle of summer the blind itself does get
mm
quite warm
yeah
and the heat from that then
we've got an old
yeah
roller blind outside which we use erm at an angle out on to the garden
well it stops the heat
in the summer which stops the heat
yeah
because it just takes the sun off the window
on the outside but it doesn't stop the light
it doesn't actually stop the light it doesn't no
of course and it's
yes
well in the continent they th they just put blinds up the outside don't they
put blinds on the outside or UNK
mm
yeah
i've seen er some nice ones in germany they had erm quite a very erm large sort of strong erm UNK blind
mm
mm
on the outside
oh
mm
and er th they looked very nice
yeah
be perfect round here wouldn't it
what we need more is
to keep the rain out
yeah
right i'll leave you to
okay
have a UNK through that
thank you
oh one other thing i should point out at this stage erm on the back of some of these
yeah
you'll see various stickers
erm as you only want one blind
mhm
take no
take no notice of those
that
unless you wanted to do something in the kitchen as well of course
yes
mm
which is a thought
this is the kind of thing you've got to be looking for and thirty three percent off
yeah
erm fifty percent off
that kind of thing
aha
if you pick one of the ones without a discount UNK on it
mhm
you might get quite a nasty shock
yeah i'm sure i would yes
okay
we're like a bit like m f i we've continually
yeah
mhm
got some sort of sale on
right
and i prices alter roughly with the seasons of the year
mm
yeah
and erm they tend to er
so thirty three percent off is off the price of one
that is off that's off the price erm this particular fabric
right
on one blind
or if you wanted
but where you sees two for the price of one you're effectively gonna be getting a fifty percent
erm
it would be it would be two for the well it actually it actually tells you doesn't it
or fifty percent reduction
so it would be two for the price of the most expensive one wouldn't it yeah
or two for a hundred and fifty or
presumably that's what it would mean
you would get
yeah
two for a
yes
two hundred and fifty pounds or
wh what no matter what erm size
so we'll suddenly find this window that's thirty foot long by seven foot high and
well yes
this is the biggest window we've got
this is the biggest window in the house it's alright
they're quite good deals if you've got er if you've
yeah
got sort of something like a couple of yeah
floor to ceiling UNK windows
mm
i won't b actually pr although UNK windows have got the greatest erm are of glass
yeah
they're not e when it comes to blinds they're not the most expensive
ah
blinds
the erm er width is far more important
oh i see
mhm
pricing them up
than drop
and they're not always so wide
erm for instance erm quite a i did one a couple of weeks ago erm on avenue
aha
and erm chap was quite surprised to find that the bedroom window worked out more than his UNK
aha
because of the width
and it was simply because it was er
yeah
it was quite a long one
right
and
and it's the track stuff is it the basic machinery that's the
yes it's far more number of UNK
yeah
you know and there's more part of the price is in not so much on the materials
it's how much work
mm
goes into making them up
that's right
right
yeah
and there's something else i would just point out before i measure your window
mhm
cos it was you said there were two or three different kinds of
yeah
track systems
yeah we do two systems
the more common one being this one
yeah
erm the blind you've got two controls
mm
you've got a chain which when you pull that can you see these
yeah
yeah
UNK that's the UNK mechanism of the UNK
and then there's a cord as well
which draws them
yeah which draws them across
yeah
then of course there's a there's a chain which UNK on there to prevent this c
yeah
kind of thing what you see now
erm this head rail in addition to white it also comes in a silver or aluminium
mm
and also UNK as well
this is the cheaper version which only comes in aluminium
mhm
and the other difference being instead of having the control at the side for drawing the blinds you've just got this simple er string
oh i see you just pull it along
pull them along that way
yeah
so
not quite so
no
the other one works out a bit more expensive
yeah
yeah
and also there's erm there's er a price increase of colour as well
mhm
erm look at this window roughly
i can give you an accurate price in a few minutes but roughly you'd pay about five pounds more
mhm
if you wanted either white or UNK
yeah
as opposed to the aluminium
mhm
i should think white would be the best
well white is the obvious isn't it i think for this one
finished decorating
well shall i
fish this tape measure out and er measure the window
right let's have a look
and it's got to be one of those UNK
well it's gonna have to be the white
do you want a UNK one or
i don't know
really what the main difference is i suppose
have you been in southwell for long
seventeen years
yeah
so that's is that roughly when this house was built
no it was about twenty two
yeah
a couple of years
i used to cut across this it used to be a field on the way home from
yeah
well it was from school when i was a lad
you were there were you at school
yeah
yeah
and er lived on gardens
oh yeah
er so erm as i remember it erm drive was only half built
right
yeah
the houses on the other side
aha
yeah
on the road side they were built erm quite a quite a while before they built the other side of the road
right
mhm
and it was quite strange it was just sort of a row of houses
yeah
and a road and then fields
yeah
yeah
just like that
but as i say it was like that for two or three years
mm
cos it was UNK land originally i think part of
this was actually yeah this was this was a field here
mm
erm that bit over there erm where close is
mhm
that was an UNK
ah
but the rest of it was just
you know l you know erm
at the end the back yes
over the back
it was just all like that you know a few UNK but mainly grass
mhm
well we were told this was the lo about the la one of the last houses to be built on this close
yeah
but er
cos i know it was and a yes the other side was built first too
mm
wasn't it
and down a little bit later
yes
just one or two people who were who were here from the start so they remembered you know th thi this was this was more or less where the builders finished off this was about the last house they did
yeah
and our front garden was a UNK
all the UNK went there
yes th as i remember they did the other side of first
right yes
mm
but erm i remember er we used to play in the houses as they were
as they were being built
yeah
it's a great game isn't it
half built houses
you had to be careful that the builders didn't catch us
that's right yeah
yeah
throwing balls of UNK to each other and a couple of them went through windows and
oh well you had a good time
do you want a fire UNK one or just in interestingly enough the ones that have got price offers on them aren't fire UNK
i think probably supposed to have fire UNK things these days
when you get to a window i don't know other than t the curtains won't be fire UNK will they
no they're not are they
you know
i'm not sure what to tell you about that one
well i'm just thinking about what's round the windows anyway
i'm quite sure that material isn't fire UNK
no
and i'm quite sure the wood isn't
given the amount of treatment
well there you are so
it's got in it
it would seem to be rather a waste of erm
mm
whatever
i'm sure it's more expensive
do you want a pure do you want a pure white or
right
mm
and the only other thing to do is to look at the at matching it
but i mean that's an almost perfect match isn't it to the furniture
this is erm quite a wide window could you
yes sure
if we start at the top
right
about erm just about UNK point at this
yeah
side bit
right then is we go down about halfway
that's a little bit wider and then er the bottom as well please
then it's back up to the top one more time
this is a UNK critical measurement
yeah
two three six point four
okay
well that's defeated me cos i measured it in feet and inches
yes we're entirely UNK apart from erm
yeah
in these UNK sizes
oh
these are these are three and a half inches wide
oh i see
and we do another one which is
yeah
five inches wide
ah
well quite a mixture
do you want the curtains moved back a bit or
no i'll be okay thanks
have me little pocket calculator out and
it should be about eight by five actually
mm
but it's very critical when you're erm
oh yes
when you've got to fit things like blinds and especially this time
is it very UNK
erm today
it's erm not too bad apart from just at this end
it's that end is it
yeah
what
erm where the UNK is
it goes off
yeah this last bit
yeah
it goes up by about erm
oh yeah
by about this amount
which would mean the UNK
yeah
it would be air packed
oh i see
otherwise it's not going to hang
you'll have to have a couple of UNK
yeah
into it just otherwise it would it would bend the UNK up
yeah
which might sort of
well also the rest of it's going to look a bit weird at the bottom isn't it
it wouldn't
that's right it would it would pull the bottom
yeah
bit up as well
it probably w probably wouldn't er run properly if
no
if it was bent
mm
right
which end do the controls normally come
on the right end
er whichever side you'd like
cos you could sh i mean we've got the curtains sort of left handed it might be an idea to have the blind pull on the left hand end as well
yes it's a bit more difficult to get at
another thing erm to tell you is erm the blinds they can either erm bunch in the left hand side
mhm
mhm
right hand side excuse me or it can be split
mhm
oh i see
there's not difference in the cost on that one
mm that splitting sounds nice
splitting
it's a good idea on a window this size
mm
cos it's wide isn't yeah
yes it is cos otherwise you end up with a big
yes on this window if you had them all UNK at one side it would be
take up half one of these
this sort of
windows wouldn't it
yeah quite a bit
mm
as opposed to two like that
yeah which is obviously better
yeah
were there any in particular that you liked
what well mainly what is the i mean these thinner ones presumably they would do the job as well as i don't know i mean it's keeping out what i want to do is to keep out the sun
yes
from the furniture so
they'll all they'll all keep the sun out
mhm
but what will happen however is erm when the sun is directly on them
yeah
it'll sort of erm light them up it'll be very
yeah
mhm
you'll have a UNK
it'll very yeah very white
mhm
erm st quite strong white UNK
mm
will come up the blind
but it will actually stop the direct rays of the sun
so you know
mm
mm
for to protect your UNK
that's right yeah
it w it'll take erm roughly about erm it'll perhaps stop about half the light
mm
coming into the room
mhm
erm when the when that's when the UNK directly
yes yeah cos it's really only the worst of the sun in the middle of the day in the summer i think that does most of the damage
although the light does light UNK anyway doesn't it
yes
but er mm
well it's got to be one of the pure white ones whatever
and can you tell me anything about the materials that are actually cos they don't
yes i can
are they better heavier than light or
erm i think it's just it's just personal erm preference really
it's choice is it whatever you the l the look rather than
mm
i just wondered is any of them were going to do a better job than
i think w i think when it comes down to s UNK they're all
mm
pretty much the same
mhm
apart from there's erm there's one at the back of the book which is er machine UNK
aha
you can actually put them in your washing machine
that sounds like a nice idea
does it
unless erm you've got sort of
mm
a problem with a heavy smoker or
mm
a coal fire or that kind of thing
there's not much
there's not much point is there
they should go they should go for quite a number of years
yes
UNK without any maintenance
mm
erm you know these are the various UNK you know this is what they're made from
oh most of them are UNK
oh they're made UNK
mm
so they're in fact they're virtually all UNK aren't they
yeah
if they do need er cleaning the advice is to use erm a very mild UNK and erm a damp cloth
mhm
but only just damp
yeah
mhm so you don't UNK it
yes because they've all got erm a UNK agent
right
yes
in the fabric
and if they get too wet they will UNK
mhm
yeah
mm
well i don't know
difficult to say isn't it
i hate being pressed for choices
just as well to give you an idea erm they come in they come in various price
yes
categories
mhm
erm with the UNK that you were looking at it's this one and they come they go from er one to six
erm for instance the cheapest one the one that is that one
mhm
that's erm price category one
yeah
er this one for instance is er here we go
yeah that's the most expensive
mhm
and so fifty percent off on this one is going to work out more expensive than thirty three percent off
mhm
yeah
on that one
mhm
mm
it's difficult to work out why some of these should be so much more expensive than others isn't it
what about that one
UNK
mm
mm
a lot of it a lot of it is just is just down to erm marketing
yeah
i think and erm
yeah
mm
i think erm most of the people who do blinds do some sort of system like this
yeah
and erm i suppose it would make it would be a lot more logical if all the blinds were just the same price all the time
yes and you chose
y but yes but we're by doing some form of sale
yeah
people see the word sale
yeah i know
they feel more inclined to buy them
and er
actually
it's just it's just unfortunate if
the one if you the one that you like doesn't happen
yeah
to be in the sale at that particular time
mm
you know in three months or six months time
it might be
yes
mm
some of them are definitely UNK than others aren't they
mm
you know
difference i don't suppose actually got the direct sun on it
mm
yeah m my erm i live on road
yeah
so my er this in my house this is a UNK window
right
and er w we've got the UNK along that wall
yeah
and that one and so erm what i do in the summer as you said when the UNK sort of at two o'clock
yeah
one o'clock it's over there and i angle my blinds in this direction and so yes
yes yeah that's it and you can do this still can't you and you can still see out
from the seats we can still see out into the garden
but it keeps we've got the television over in this corner
and you can still see
it ke yeah we can still see the telly
aha
also it keeps the sun off it
yeah
and keeps it off the carpet as well
yes
that's right yeah
mm
i quite like that one actually
UNK mm
mm
just not too plain it's got some
yeah that's quite a popular one that is
mm
a lady at 's just erm ordered one of those this morning
i think i like that one actually
yeah
what do you think
well i you know i
doesn't make a i know
it doesn't make a lot of difference really
once they're up they're up
once they're up they erm up you you're not gonna notice really after a while
mm
what it what it is
some of them erm the pattern
but i yes that one i think
shows through more than others
yes
if you want to take them out of the book
mm
and just hold them up to light you quite welcome to do so
mm yes well i can actually see you know
that that's got a sort of a
you've got a line across there
which i think's quite attractive
mm
how l how long are they supposed to last things like this
or is that a stupid question
depends on
i don't know
your house and what you what you do in it
yeah
i've got erm a fourteen month old baby
mm
mm
and er erm i've only got one vertical and that's on the UNK and of course it's within his reach
yeah
we've got the er chains on the bottom that UNK the UNK so UNK hold of those
yeah
and giving them a good pull
so how long the UNK going to last i don't know
mm
perhaps about another six months
we did know somebody erm down on actually who had a vertical blind and several of the chains had broken or disappeared on the bottom of that
yeah
the blind worked alright
but that's probably not gonna happen along there won't be anything else on the UNK
that's it was it was as you say over a UNK door it was actually being used as an entrance door as well
yeah
so people were constantly sort of UNK this aside and walking through
little dogs as well tend to er get UNK up
yes
in the bottom
yes
of blinds
or cats in her in her case it was cats yes
it was cats in her case
had to replace one erm er close
mm
the other week
mm
and that was in a right state
the lady's had it about ten years but she's got a little dog as well
mm
and erm there were hardly any chains left on it
yeah
well i think it is they ought to last a fair time they i mean it's not gonna be abused really is it at those windows
no
shall i work you a price out
work it out for that one please
yes please
right
got some lovely colours
mm
i don't really think
be a bit heavy there wouldn't it i think
mm
the thing to bear in mind with the colours
is erm well i wasn't gonna say that
well that i was thinking actually with that colour
you might do i do erm red one might UNK a bit i don't know
mm
generally w red erm red cars sure they UNK
mm
yes
i've made that mistake in the past
mm
i buy white now
yeah
or
yes
no i think white for here is best cos the sun is quite i mean you get quite a lot of sun don't you on this side of the house
yeah with erm with the colours though that's what i was going to say the thing to bear in mind is it's like choosing erm paint or wallpaper
mm
you see a small sample there you think oh yeah that that's quite good
but when it's
when it's a big
when it's a lot bigger it's the shade
mm
mm
tends to be t to seem a lot UNK
all the colouring a lot more bold
you know the larger the area
sit down
it's ages since i've been able to sit on the UNK
is it
mm
oh the UNK
UNK is turned up
mm
mm
have another go
right the one you UNK was UNK was it
yes it was
right
mhm
having trouble with both these pens today i left them in the car last night i think they must have got a bit cold
i've got borrow this borrow this blue one if you like
it was working
do you want to sit down
yeah thanks
right
well i can push this back against the
space again
right you said you'd prefer a white head rail didn't you
yes
yes
yeah
erm there are two other erm factors i've got to look at
mhm
to work the price out
erm i mentioned earlier chains on the bottom of the UNK
mhm
which they're er a little chains which
yeah
mhm
UNK the UNK
the idea behind them is that erm the UNK
yeah they hang a bit more erm UNK
erm just difference they would make to the price
these back ones the so called concept ones are all machine UNK
mm
so it said
oh well
yeah i think th there are some there that aren't actually
oh
that UNK not quite correct
erm these are these are definitely
yeah
erm we've just the they've just been altered actually
mm
since christmas
i think yeah the information that you see on here is incorrect i'm afraid it's just
yeah it's just those
yeah
they should have some stickers on saying machine wash UNK
yeah
i don't know
but i'm fairly certain it's just those
yeah
it'll be alright as long as long as you keep them
yeah i could see your mother going
the idea behind this machine UNK bit it's
yeah
for it's er places like erm pubs or
where you've got smokers or you've got an open fire
UNK
or something yes
yeah
yeah
more of a commercial thing
mm
and erm we've just actually we've just erm i've not got a sample of it we've just got another UNK called a which is erm a p v c it's more sort of similar to erm you know the UNK on a UNK blind
mm
similar to one of those
mm
but actually in the vertical
mm
totally different
but they can just be wiped anyway
yes
mm
that was a job i always hated UNK the UNK blind
spend all day and still not get it out
i thought the idea was to keep them UNK al if you can keep them UNK regularly then
mm
UNK a good idea
a tremendous range of choice though haven't they
mm
you can colour coordinate almost anything
the one in the in the you know the erm machine UNK ones is an almost exact match to this
i think it would i think the colour would UNK
yeah probably
you'd have the same problem with the blinds you're trying to avoid with er
and i know white UNK as well but then i think
no i'm not keen
i assume you didn't want to think about the kitchen
no
yeah
that's one place you would need it to be UNK
we've got a blind anyway
given the yes
mm
which you just pull down to wherever you need it in the summer
erm yes one other thing
erm it's affects the price
yeah
and that's the erm width of the UNK
mhm
the ones that you see in the book they're three and a half inches
erm the other one is a five inch
mm
which is kind of width
yeah
mhm
erm it's entirely yo don't to your own personal choice which one you go for
however the three and a half inch works out more expensive
because you've got more of them
because you've got more of them
yeah
yeah
about fifteen percent er ro roughly fifteen percent extra
what width has your mum got then
there's plenty of width there
on a large window like this you'd get away with the five inch one
mm
look out of place
it's only on the sort of very small windows that it would look
mm
yeah
too big
yeah all right
it's because it'll be that reduces then the number of pieces of machinery and the number of
mm
it also means that they'll draw back to a UNK profile doesn't it
is that rotten dog UNK again
she seems to spend all day asleep i don't know what she does at night
does she sleep at night as well
yeah i think erm actually my there's probably nothing wrong with my pens i'm trying to write on the back of this paper it's paper
yes it's not yes
mm
right the price erm f for erm that UNK that comes out at one hundred and seventeen pounds
mhm
eighty pence
erm if that's sounds too much th the way we could make it cheaper it erm not to have erm the UNK chains
the cost of those on a blind this size is sixteen pounds
mm
yeah
erm if you didn't have those erm what would happen instead is the erm the UNK are a are still UNK at the bottom but it's a slightly smaller weight
it's actually and it's actually UNK in into the UNK as opposed to the er the larger weights
they just slot through and then the chains clip on
so that one would come out then at erm just over a hundred pounds
mm
it's up to you do you want the chains on the bottom or
well i think so yes yeah
you know you know what's gonna happen i if they aren't
well they would tend to swing around a bit more
well what tends to happen is erm when the blinds erm the only time it's a bit UNK is when the blinds completely closed
mm
mm
because what you n notice is there's about sort of erm getting on towards half an inch overlap between the UNK
and that's the UNK part because
yeah
mm
it erm it's you're doubling the material UNK and so you tend to you get dark
you'll see lines
dark strips
and so you might see of them
that's right some which m could possibly a bit wider than
yeah
others
yeah it'll look like UNK that are on UNK
yeah the chains are more important the higher the window is
yeah
on a small window really not
that's quite a e erm a high window really isn't it cos it's
yeah
the UNK is low
you're sort of halfway UNK yeah between the an average size window and a UNK
and a UNK yeah
yeah
go with the chains
i would think it would actually hang better
yeah
mm
yeah
you that price is okay then is it
i would think so yes
mm
some people are quite shocked when they find out it's more than
oh
than they were quoted over the phone but
having erm been into various things like this i think we're almost UNK by now
er what we are gonna do and obviously we're in the process of you're the first at the moment is to have two or three quotations from different people
yeah sure
to do it so erm if you can let us have a copy in writing of your
yeah i'll erm i'll give you a full quote
and then erm if erm if you get somebody else in
yeah
who's erm who's offering you an equivalent system
yeah
to the one that i've come up with erm i e the white UNK and
yeah
which operates in the same way
yeah
and with a very similar fabric then i'll try and my best to beat their quote
understood
you know we don't like to be beaten
well no
although i've no doubt you know better than we do what the opposition are
well
are offering or not
i think we're all pretty much the same actually
yes
yeah
yeah well
my blinds are in my house erm none of them are blinds
mm
because i bought them all before t i started
right
started this job and er i i've got erm
no i haven't approached them i've contacted blinds haven't i
i don't know who you've
i've got a list upstairs of various people i've got one person
you've only got one yes you've got somebody coming
i got my i got my vertical from the one at newark and the UNK blind centre
yeah
and erm i don't think there's a lot to choose from actually
yes we were gonna go in and see them weren't we
i d i don't know
yeah
you did the phoning i haven't got a clue
yeah they've got books very similar and i think they're pricing UNK pretty similar as well
yeah
mm
roughly the same i expect we shall go with you
well be more essentially the material
the only thing that i've just thought about actually is window wh in the me on the measurement side rather than anything else is that i haven't because we've just had those windows replaced i haven't finished decorating around the top
this wood chip paper does it's fairly thick isn't it as a paper will that make a lot of difference to your actually measurement that you make
i know it's about that much isn't it
yeah erm w what i've done i've measured i've taken an exact measurement
yeah
from the UNK to the
and obviously it's go it's gotta be
and the blind is then made approximately er twenty millimetres shorter
so that it'll allow for
so we're talking about three quarters of an inch
yeah
so th
cause o the frame at the bottom is gonna
yeah it's guaranteed to clear the UNK
yeah just ab i just thought i'd mention it just in case
yeah
and also when i took the measurement i took actually took it
you took
from the smallest and also
yeah
that UNK there's quite a big slope on it as well
there is isn't there
and it UNK towards the window so i've actually taken the measurement nearest the erm windows itself to be on the safe side
in fact i bit silly because this was the only room i didn't bother to finish round the windows and round the doorway
and i didn't make any mess whatsoever i mean you wouldn't know replaced the window
yeah
so i wished i'd done it all in the first place now i've got to do it
that was your mother
had
oh she wanted to know about the door
we heard anything about the door
i said no
they were only gonna ring us if there was anything wrong and i had this horrible feeling at that point that was the vet ringing up to say things had gone wrong
it's number fifteen isn't it
it's fifteen yeah
yes you're actually e sitting outside the original house as it was built cos we had a room put on for the back here originally
oh i see
that was the end of the house
it's all a bit confusing now cos we've i've just finished altering the whole of the middle of it but this it was a twenty four foot long main lounge
yeah
just straight through to the front of the house
with a fireplace in the middle but they've now put dividing walls in taken the old frame out from the back and this was originally built as an additional room on the back
yeah
but we've now moved the music things that we had out here into the little room at the front
right
is that er
turned this into a UNK
that wall there er an original wall
the one on the left is the one on the right isn't
i've only just finished building the one on the right
on that side
that was the cupboard under the stairs it's now a UNK
yeah
yeah m my father in law lives on place
yeah
and er i'm just trying to work out if it's the same style as this
this is a four bedroomed one
they're very similar
they're very similar
yes the ones round there are they're the same yeah
they're the same pattern
the three and four bedroom
people who knew us before and haven't been here since get terribly confused when they walk in and rather wonder everything has gone to
did that get too much heat when i was gone
no
they don't l they want more light
yeah
well they're not gonna get it are they
no
it's alright it wasn't the vet it was your grandmother
i would assume by now that erm you know that they've finished operating and it's alright
cos they normally do them after they've done their morning surgery don't they some time about half ten or eleven
yeah
i think
UNK
well the other thing i was thinking of was if we if we felt we needed to put a new roller blind at the window
mm
i mean plain white ones whatever
no
although that's never a problem is it with large
i don't think it needs no i don't think it really needs one but if we did
sorry where were you thinking of doing a roller
well i was just wo wondering about that window but i pr i think i prefer just a curtain and i don't think i could put both there because the roller
i was gonna say y could probably do a roller in the same fabric as
yeah
mm
it's just that i've i mean i want a curtain there as well because otherwise it all looks a bit heavy but i don't think i could put a blind down there because of the way
i don't think you'd get
we wouldn't no i wo
apart from anything else the door won't open
no that's the other problem isn't it
yeah
it's bad enough with a curtain rail on there
the only other alternative would to actually put it itself
oh we've got the curtain is on the door itself
oh the curtain is on the door
yes otherwise the door won't open properly will it
but the er the UNK
the clearance when the door is open to the piece of wall there is only that much
oh i see
that's a i had to do a little bit of er UNK work on the on the curtain rail put that on
right
there's your quote then
get me glasses get me glasses
alright so that was the colour wasn't it
yes
the UNK white
erm
so i've quoted you there for the chains
five inch width
five inch yeah
the three and a half inch is as i said it's approximately
yeah
fifteen percent extra
mhm
but the five inch would be okay on there
yeah
this is just this bunch and control
i you decide to order it which side split or whatever and where you want the controls
aha i see
yeah
well we we'd want the controls on the left and we want them to be split
we don't need to worry about that
mhm
but that do that doesn't matter yet
right and a white UNK as well
yeah
mhm
a hundred and seventeen eighty
that is that is a complete price including vat and that includes
includes fitting
fitting on them as well
mhm
who comes and does the fitting
you
me
right
same person
o odd occasion we'll come across people you know who yes he seems to be the right person and then somebody else turns up to do
good morning ladies and gentlemen
i think it's slightly after the UNK hour so that i think we should begin
may i first welcome you all here
it's very good to see you and er i hope the day will be UNK for all of us
can i begin by making er couple of apologies
our chairman
geoffrey is UNK from er an operation on his back and barbara although not here this morning hopefully may well be here this afternoon but she's been UNK by a fall which er broke her leg
and i'm sure that er you would wish me er hope they both get well very soon as i say barbara hopefully will be here er this afternoon
erm it's been an important year for us and i think that you may recall that last year we talked a bit about the UNK report and er if you look at the directors er report you will see that quite a lot of the work that we talked about and was in the UNK report is now under way and i think it's very important
er our importance has er frankly now been recognised by the prime minister who talked about the voluntary organisations not very long ago and referred to us as UNK which holds society together and i think if that's right and hopefully the government may take a bit more notice of us
erm because of the UNK reports i mentioned to you last year we're going to have to raise more money than we thought sometime ago
and i'd like to say that er diana er has been extremely helpful and i've given her a bit of he aid in trying to raise that kind of money
as you know our er director left er in the middle of the year
UNK and er i'd like on your behalf to thank you for all she did and to wish her well in whatever else she decides to do
er we have in her place judy whose sitting here and i know that every official and i hope yourselves will give her all the support that she will need in this job and to say to her your very welcome and i know we're going to enjoy having you with us
erm may i just say that you may recall that at the nineteen eighty eight a g m we agreed that they'd be no smoking here er and i hope that er can be UNK to er and finally er i have a fairly full agenda and the officials have sort of er measured it to the nearest minute
why allowed three minutes for but i might extend that to three and a quarter i think if the time goes well
well now you've had the minutes of the last a g m meeting that blue copy and may i take it that er you accept those and we can agree that they are accepted
thank you very much that's very helpful to me
thank you
now we come to resolution one which is the annual report the accounts and the auditors and although geoffrey is not here er we've done a video of him which is now about to be shown who will introduce er this and i just like to say that this has been sponsor the cost of it has been sponsored by the shell international UNK company to whom we are very grateful if my head pops up and UNK some of the shout down will you
may i add my own very warm welcome to
the absence of one ordinary officer at the annual general meeting may appear a UNK of two UNK but may i assure you that we are with you in spirit that the loss is ours alone and that the proceedings will be conducted with their usual UNK and efficiency despite and i hope no one said before our absence from
the year has been one of change of achievement and of challenge
we have seen most UNK in left us to be succeeded by
for the clarity of in dealing with the a particular contribution has laid in developing the relationship between the sector and government
and as for the UNK year and that they be paid for the services a sum to be determined by the n c v o executive committee
thank you
thank you very much indeed
i can now ask er geoffrey to second the motion please
good morning erm do i need to switch something on oh it's working now
good morning i must say i stand before you today somewhat nervous because erm this is this is my first to you as treasurer but this will be a slightly different speech from one's that i have given in previous years
UNK suffer the erm the occupational hazard that they always to some extent have to cry UNK
they have to advise caution in the use of finance
they have to judge quite carefully the extent to which they should er advise the caution because if they advise too much caution then erm er people will er UNK themselves and then perhaps if things aren't really bad no longer believe the treasurer
if they too much caution then erm if they advise too little caution then things can run away with themselves
so in the past few years i have given a speech which has drawn attention to the deficit on our general fund and our need for continued care to reduce the deficit
erm some years ago the executive committee set us the target of reducing our deficit to nil and reducing the deficit to nil by the year ninety one ninety two
i have to say that the year wo i that i'm reporting on now nineteen ninety one was actually better than we had originally planned and expected and in fact that we did eliminate the deficit in that year
if you look at the accounts you will see that they record a deficit on the general fund of a hundred and twenty three thousand but if you deal if you UNK more carefully in the accounts more closely you will find in fact that the money we raised on the appeal fund was greater than that deficit shown on the general fund and so in fact our income during the year was greater than our expenditure and we have achieved a small surplus
it was achieved erm through reorganisation it was achieved through careful planning of expenditure but there was also an element of luck in that erm the staff vacancy level that we had pending the reorganisation was higher than we had planned for
but nevertheless i think it is a substantial achievement er and it reflects well on our former director and it reflects well on our staff that it has been made
th there are also now prospects for a modest surplus in the current financial year and our projections show that zero deficit is achievable in the future years with a continued drive for care in expenditure and for the rising of income
but i would slip back to my normal UNK cautious self and say that we do need to balance the years of deficit we have had with years of surplus we need to look at n c v o's finances over a longer term than simply one year
we need to take the deficit years with the surplus years and so simply because we have a surplus it doesn't mean to say we can go out and start spending
we do need to continue to control our expenditure and to be careful about raising income and where appropriate charging for services
one area where the accounts do show some growth though is in special projects
there was a very substantial increase in UNK ninety one and i'm happy to say that all but two of those projects have been fully funded by UNK and in fact our policy now and this is operated from the first of april this year is that all projects shall be fully funded by UNK and that includes a contribution to the overheads that erm the projects incur
the market value of our investments rose to er two point one million
there have been drawings on those investments though mainly the main two have been to fund the redundancies associated with the reorganisation and to grant a UNK to n a c v s on its independence from the council
our investments now all match er the ethical investment policy which has been agreed by the investment panel
i would by the way like to thank the members of the investment panel for the help and support they've given me and also in fact to point out that erm although s er your chairman has spoken of sir ray UNK his formal links with the council i have to say that we still do have one or two UNK still attached to him in that he remains on as a very valued member of the investment panel and will continue to provide his wisdom and advice for which we are all very grateful
the progress towards our erm compliance with our ethical investment policy though has been achieved while considering the need to secure the best returns possible on our investment and we have done it through a series of progressive sales of investments at the appropriate times according to the market conditions and so i'm happy to say that we have been able to achieve both our responsibilities as trustees our responsibility both to secure the best return on investment and to consider wider policy implications of our investment policy
i think i should point out though that erm in the future there will we are planning some substantial drawings on our funds
erm firstly for office UNK to improve the effectiveness with which our staff can operate and secondly for the office accommodation itself
i think members will probably by now be aware that a decision has been taken to leave the offices in UNK square where we have been for so many years
i don't think anyone will dispute that those are not offices suited to us in the nineties
there not offices best calculated to enable us to perform effectively
we have identified a new property which we can move to and it is available to us either to rent or to buy
two years ago when the prospect of moving was first raised erm i was very firmly of the opinion that we should continue to rent our offices because i didn't believe that erm we were a property speculation company
i believe that we are the national council for voluntary organisations in a very different business
i have to say though that market conditions have changed very substantially in the last couple of years and we now have an opportunity before us which is one which is unlikely to UNK again
we need to move at the same time that the property market is in a substantial UNK and th are therefore offices available to us at a very competitive price
and in fact if we are able to negotiate a loan to buy the new premises we should be able to do so on terms which would enable our UNK of the loan to be comparable with what we are currently paying an and would expect to pay in rent
so i hope very much that erm at the end of the current financial year i shall be able to give a even more optimistic erm report that not only have we brought the current account deficit under control but that in fact the organisation is in a much UNK financial position for the long term
and er i think i wo i would wish to extend my thanks to all the finance staff er particularly ann in helping us to arrive at this position
so in summing up then i feel slightly nervous that it is a different speech from the one i normally give but i am confident that we are now able to go forward much more UNK based on a much stronger financial position
and i therefore second the resolution one for the adoption of the accounts
well thank you very much er geoffrey erm that was a very full and i think er and as he says cautious account of what's been happening and he does remind me of all the finance officers that i've ever known in this thing i've never really seen or rarely seen them smile
er which is probably a good thing
the ones that smile incidentally usually go the UNK court so i think we're in good shape here
now as i say it's been a fairly full account but just before i put er the motion to you are there any points or questions you'd like to raise no well thank you very much
er we've read the resolution out to you er it's been appropriately proposed and seconded
may i ask all those in favour please to show their hands those against
the resolution is carried
thank you very much
now we now come to resolution two which is in effect the appointment of the er honorary officers
i think you've all seen who they are and i don't propose to read those un unless you think i should but they're there i think on the er papers that you've er received
so may i ask erm er where are we i keep forgetting
andrea
oh yes andrea that's right
may i ask andrea to er proposed the motion please
thank you i shall do nothing further than read out erm a list of all the officers who erm president vice president the right honourable dr leslie mr peter the honourable kenneth and vice president alan
chairman vice chair honorary treasurer i'm sure all of us who are involved in the executive council of n c v o will recognised that
thank you very much andrea
er now may i ask mr graham to second that motion please
it would probably to appropriate for me to er second the motion in welsh er but as you're and neither the english welsh i would just like to say a few things one to express the appreciation of my council for the and secondly to
well thank you very much
er well the names have been read out to you
and the motion is in effect to elect or to re elect them
may i have all those in favour please to show their hands
thank you
those against
the motion is carried
now we now come to er the resolution to er
three
it's resolution er three and it is to er in effect to er appoint the executive committee and i don't propose to read through all those er but perhaps tony can help me
erm all i need to say about these i think is that where the statement er to be announced is we'll give you the names
the only thing we can't do is under community organisation eight to give you the name of the representative of organisation development
we haven't yet got that but we will give it to you in due course
er we've got well
the two under n a c v s erm chair are christine and
unfortunately we also now that tim can't erm fulfil the responsibilities in the planning and environment electoral college and robert will take his place
thank you very much
er can i ask now er mr leslie to propose the resolution please
sorry chairman i
i er i do beg your pardon
mr chairman in his er video to us er drew attention to the both the external and internal challenges which face us at the present time
it is essential that we should maintain both our sensitivity and our effectiveness if we are to protect and watch over the interests of the people we work for and provide the kind of services they need
i think therefore we are extremely fortunate that so many people of distinction and talent are willing to give up time to serve on the executive of the n c v o to work with the UNK officers and the director and her team to ensure that n c v o maintain such a central role in watching over our interests and in promoting the concerns of the people of this country that we are all so active about
i would just like to say record our thanks to those who are retiring and to welcome most UNK those who have come forward to serve and to propose the list er last but certainly not least our UNK thanks to UNK and her colleagues in the voluntary services unit for their ongoing and invaluable support to n c v o er throughout the years
er i have pleasure in proposing resolution three i think you have UNK me chairman from reading out all the names
of course thank you very much
er i must apologise again for what er the way i addressed you but of course with all these women equality er movements going on i never know whether its mr mrs or UNK erm now i may call on doctor UNK to second the motion please
we thought he might not quite make it in time
may i have a seconder please from the er audience for this
now don't be shy
thank you
what is give us your name please
thank you
thank you very much indeed
well you've got the list of names and er i think mrs was quite right in asking not to read them all out
but er we'd we obviously like your agreement to er to this very important er resolution
may i have a show of hands from all those in favour please
thank you anyone against
well thank you very much indeed er the resolution is er carried
erm we're coming as it were to the end of the first part of the proceedings er but i'd like to give a brief thanks to the er c r group that's the charities recruitment group for the part sponsorship of this a g m conference
they gave us a thousand pound that is really very important i think and we're most grateful
erm and that really is the end of as it were i beg your pardon yes
before you end a few minutes er mr president i wonder if i can just say er that you may remember this really is a matter arising but you may remember that at the last meeting of the annual general meeting of n c v o er my organisation the national federation of community organisations was bold enough to propose a resolution other than those required and it is in your minutes if you have them
i really just wanted to record our appreciation erm and i think those of others too
er for what n c v o has done in the year
i'm not saying necessarily in response to that resolution but at least in the direction that we were hoping
the resolution was about encouraging n c v o to give er ad adequate and appropriate support and weight to the needs of small organisations as well as the needs of larger charities and voluntary organisations
and it is our experience in a number of ways that n c v o has over this last year done that very thing and i wanted just to record that and i'm thinking particularly but there are other examples of the work on the charities bill er and the work that n c v o's doing in relation to the UNK group
erm and also er the UNK the work involving the training trustees working party
i'm sure there are other examples but i just really wanted to record that appreciation
well thank you very much indeed we er appreciate that and i'm sure the staff will appreciate it thank you
well as i say er the this part of the meeting is now formally ended and i'm going to hand over to er kay who will chair the next session er which involves of course as you've seen presentations by the n c v o senior staff
ca can i just say one thing though if you me nip out it's not that i don't want to listen to this er it's in connection with the property er worries that er geoffrey said i've got to sign a lot of er arm UNK letters which i they want me to sign today so if i can take five minutes out to sign those i hope you will not feel i'm trying to er UNK off as it were
sue
thank you
thank you
you may now begin
i may now begin good
my sex is determined
well good morning again and welcome ladies and gentlemen members of council colleagues and friends
we now come to the second part of our programme according to our agenda which has the broad heading UNK n c v o achievements and intentions and it's obviously a natural follow on from the i er a g m which we have just completed at which council received the annual report of n c v o's work for the past year and its use of the resources which are available to it to carry out that work
we now i think er going to hear from members of the management team more detailed information on working progress and priority issues
judy our new director will lead her team of simon richard and to and er tony and i think it seems particularly er appropriate and important that judy at her first appearance here as director although many of us present i know would remember her wearing other hats should have this opportunity of speaking the councillor members and giving us some idea of how the management team see the future before us in the years to come
judy you lead
thank you very much
this is an UNK exciting time to be joining n c v o i took over from at the beginning of september nineteen ninety one with the reorganisation UNK fully in place and a clear strategic plan to fulfil our role as the voice of the voluntary sector
that's quite a UNK task
my job is to implement our mission to promote a thriving and effective voluntary sector
by providing leadership representation and support
in a UNK i see n c v o as something like perhaps the c b i of the voluntary sector
well we're here in this building perhaps we have some differences of course we can't quite match the c b is resources but who knows
through our membership we represent an enormous range of voluntary sector interests and as you can see from our electoral college headings such as education and training employment and leisure ethnic UNK health and disability income maintenance and poverty personal family services planning an environment women you professional UNK society public bodies trusts and foundations my goodness what a list
what a diversity
it is UNK to see the newly independent off shoots of n c v o join the ranks of members such as the national association the council for voluntary services the organisation development unit and the black environment network
and also our most recent UNK the UNK who are about to do so this year
n c v o has a proud record over the years of developing and promoting new initiatives to meet new needs and to fill gaps in voluntary sector initiatives
many of those which we have helped into independence are now household names such as age concern national association of UNK advice UNK
however the ranks are much more numerous as you can see
all are playing important parts in the voluntary sector
as i now personally from one of my previous lives in nineteen eighty two when i became the first director of the newly independent national federation of community organisations
erm but i didn't prime the previous speaker who spoke so nicely er about n c v o even though we do seem to be in a mutual UNK society
n c v o will carry on with this vital role and UNK and UNK the dynamics of the voluntary sector
n c v o works in partnership with many other organisations
in the voluntary commercial and statutory sectors
to achieve our goals and of course we work closely with our sister councils in scotland northern ireland and wales and we put domestic issues in the wider european and international scene as well
over the coming years i want to see us widen and extend our membership and our UNK with other charities even further
we need to improve the ways in which you are involved in n c v o's work thus giving UNK to voice and UNK n c v o and our members in the causes that we all care about
we care about the voluntary sectors independence its innovation its flexibility and its UNK to the needs of those without financial power
the manifesto which n c v o produced recently UNK many of our concerns and UNK the government and other political UNK other political parties to make improvements to respond to your concerns
i have found an excellent team of people who are highly committed and motivated and who work for n c v o as honorary officers of staff as members of all the various committees and working groups task forces er and think tanks and any other name that we can think up to involve you
i am very proud to have this opportunity to work with all of you to promote the UNK of the voluntary sector
some areas of our work will be discussed in much greater detail in the seminars this afternoon
on charity and politics on europe on communications and on trustee training
these represent some of the major issues currently on our agenda
we believe that n c v o has a key role to play in involving the voluntary sector in representing your concerns
some of the work we do supporting the voluntary sector and providing services will also be reflected in the stores and displays that we're making available over the lunch period
they cover our oral work our advice services our membership and affiliation services and our publications
now i am delighted to be able to hand over the spot light to my three management colleagues on the management team
tony in charge of services and communication simon in charge of policy and development richard in charge of resource development and although it's not on the script and she said i mustn't to the script i ought to mention also UNK who has joined us as head of communications on whom you may thank for all the sort of UNK that we're having and the bright idea of UNK er our chairman
so i look forward to her input as well to our image and our presentation
thank you very much
thank you very much judy
we'll go straight through the presentations and then there is an opportunity obviously for you to ask questions or and to join in generally discussion
so if i go straight over and invite simon to address us next please
it's great
super
morning
it is clear that er one of n c v o principle functions is to act as the voice of the voluntary sector
representing the interests and reflecting the concerns of voluntary organisations and charities throughout england
of course this does not mean that we're the only voice speaking up on behalf of the voluntary sector
many voluntary organisations including numbers of our members many present here today will be speaking UNK in the interests of particular groups within society with which they work
but it undoubtedly does fall to n c v o and rightly so to take the responsibility of representing the interests of the sector on a range of general issues
if n c v o is to be able to fulfil this purpose effectively we must be working closely with our members and we must have their confidence and respect and such confidence of course is a two way process
n c v o needs to be sharing its knowledge its information and general resources with its members and also needs to ensure that its work is firmly UNK in the experience and knowledge of the UNK of voluntary organisations and charities with which contact is maintained on a regular basis
now it seems to me that er the watch word for our policy development work over the next few years must be effective co ordination with our members and the wider voluntary sector
our principle function within the policy development department within n c v o must be to work with and not simply for our member and the wider sector
other constituencies of course are important
central government local authorities the academic communities and so on they are undoubtedly important but they are subsidiary to the interest of the sector itself
n c v o must therefore draw together voluntary organisations effectively and be seen to be responsive and creative
there are many issues where a n c v o should be exercising leadership sometimes a rather difficult concept and there is no need to apologise for that for using leadership at the right time but it has to be a leadership by consent rather than claimed without authority and it is in this context that the policy development department in n c v o exists to help channel voluntary sector concerns to opinion UNK and policy makers regardless of party politics regardless of political commitment
and following n c v o recent reorganisation the policy development department broadly consists of the following
i thought it was useful to repeat this for other peoples information
firstly we have an economic policy team
concentrating its attention on central and local government funding of the voluntary sector itself
the implications of the efficiency scrutiny review training and employment and UNK issues
secondly we have now a UNK named social and public policy team which is UNK covering charity law local government structural changes the right of duty of voluntary organisations to campaign work with the new national forum on the environment and health and community care issues
thirdly our policy analysis and research team takes responsibility for looking further ahead and doing a lot of the initial thinking about both the challenges and the opportunities that will affect the sector UNK and internationally over the next few years
UNK the department covers parliamentary lobbying work our european and international responsibilities
it supports the national self help support centre and the waste watch project
we all know that we have yet again a busy and exciting year in front of us
the new year sees the publication of changing europe
this book will help readers to understand the single european market not an easy thing in itself and how it may affect voluntary organisations and users
undoubtedly n c v o existing work relating to the european community and the voluntary sector has become ever more important year by year
already much work has been done on the impact of the single market on voluntary organisations
the implications of the moves towards greater e c integration for the sector encouraging the development of effective networks of voluntary organisations across the community as a whole and building relationships with all the institutions of the european community to ensure that the interests of the voluntary sector in the united kingdom are both maintained and UNK enhanced
we often claim for instance that this country has a particularly unique and UNK voluntary sector which is not matched elsewhere
if this is so we need to be positive and confident about our experiences and we should try to export our best UNK to others in the community
we will no doubt find and again rightly so that we have as much to learn from others as to give
the prime minister's recent speech at the charities aid foundation conference indicates that the government is going to make the encouragement of voluntary sector across the er community and in encouragement of voluntary activity a principle focus of the u k presidency of the community from july next year
that will give us many important opportunities which we must not let drop
n c v o has taken the initiative in putting up a number of ideas to the prime minister's and the home office to make this commitment a meaningful one and a constructive one for voluntary organisations in this country
we are also UNK on vitally important work on the new charity law legislation which has been referred to already on local government legislation in relation to both the structure of local government and the new council tax system
and only yesterday at n c v o's annual lobby conference on the implications of the queen's speech we were talking with a number of our members about legislative priorities for the period up to the forthcoming general election whenever that is
finally i can't finish without mentioning health and community care
the publication of the government's green paper health of the nation and all the work going on around the country on the implementation programme for the community care reforms means that n c v o must attempt to rebuild its own capacity to undertake effective policy development work in these areas
we continue to support and chair the community care alliance of voluntary organisations a very important development in the last few years
our director serves on one of the official department of UNK steering groups dealing with health of the nation and its implementation
we're also very hopeful that we will have some extra support and assistance in this field at n c v o within the near future
now these of course are just a few of the areas that the n c v o's policy development work is intending to cover and will be concentrating on in the year ahead
if we're to do this work effectively er then it has to be in conjunction with you
therefore i come back to where i started
working in conjunction effectively with you our members and it has to meet your needs and interests as well as our own and i'm therefore looking forward to the possibility in fact the certainty of us having a year of achievement us for the interests of the voluntary sector
thank you
thank you very much simon
i now ask richard to address please
thank you
good morning
as well as addressing some of the major policy issues affecting the sector n c v o also has an important role in helping voluntary organisations to do their job better
voluntary organisations need practical advise on fund raising legal issues accountancy and many other aspects of their work
they also need to be able to manage their affairs effectively and learn to develop constructive partnerships
it's the role of the resource development department to ensure that they get the advise and help they need to do this either from n c v o or from others
the department also has a specific interest in ensuring n c v o is sensitive to the needs of rural areas and rural voluntary organisations
to help us develop a strategic approach to advise provision we've embarked on a mapping exercise
this will involve a national survey early next year funding by thames UNK and others to establish where voluntary organisations currently get their advice from
what they think of current provision and what the main gaps are both now and in the future and the outcome will be a five year advice development strategy which will be publishing to guide both n c v o and other providers and UNK
one of the UNK growing interests in the voluntary sector is the environment
yet most environmental groups are not currently plugged into existing sources of advice and do not have a tradition of working together
we therefore established a new three year environmental support project funded by the d o e and b p to address these concerns
other important activities in our advice development team include fund raising advice increasing access to national UNK qualifications and running a short course programme which is the largest programme of its kind in the country
advance in good management is the main theme of our management development team as well as being the title of a new three year project we launched last year
seven regional initiatives are now being funded with the help of the v s u the department of trade and industry and a number of private sector UNK including british telecom save and UNK b p and i b m the lessons from these projects and others will be widely promoted
earlier this year we also established a joint working party with the charity commission on trustee training
with UNK as chair and diane as vice chair the working party has received evidence from over fifty people as well as conducting its own survey of trustees and management committees with a UNK framework of regulation resulting from the charity bill it will be more important than ever that trustees are aware of their very considerable responsibilities and well equipped to take them on
the working party will be publishing its report next april
voluntary organisations need to work more and more in partnership with others
for their part other sectors like local government health authorities civil servants private companies and other agencies also need advice on how to work with the voluntary sector
we already run the n c v o corporate affiliation scheme which next year we plan to expand and develop and we've just launched l a link a new subscription service for local authorities providing advice and information on the development of partnership and there's an exhibition about this in the UNK
contracting is a particular form of relationship between the public and voluntary sectors which is causing considerable concern amongst voluntary organisations
recognising the importance of this issue we've been able to develop a three year project to provide training advice and information to voluntary groups about how best to respond to the contract culture
this has been UNK supported by the department of health the UNK foundation bearing trust allied UNK and will be launching that early next year
finally the rural team in the resource development department plays a vital role in ensuring all n c v o's work takes on board the rural dimension
through promoting rural voluntary action and developing community care in rural areas the rural team never let us forget that over twenty per cent of the population live in rural areas
this will be my last n c v o a g m as a member of staff since i'm leaving at the end of january to become chief executive of arthritis care
however i'm very much looking forward to being a member of n c v o as well as being a consumer of its excellent services and while i've got the platform i'd like to take this opportunity to wish judy every success as director of n c v o i think she's got off to a marvellous start and i'm sure that n c v o's gonna UNK under her leadership
thank you
thank you very much richard
i shall resist the temptation to say all sorts of nice things about you at this point because there would be other opportunities obviously
i'll ask tony now to address us please
take my watch madam chairman
oh yes
thank you kay
good morning everyone
it's perhaps fitting that the services and communication department should bring up the rear in this group of presentations because one of its key priorities is to provide a coherent professional support service to the organisation as a whole
this is reflected in that of n c v o's three strategic objectives which relates to improving its own operational effectiveness and UNK recognition of its role
making sure n c v o's operation is fit for this task is a team of people who UNK include personnel training information and technology communications fund raising finance office management and of course the law
in looking back at the department's achievements one has to accept that reorganisation which judy and simon have already referred to has because of its sheer scale and impact on n c v o been something of an UNK over the past twelve to eighteen months
the main work load on UNK the implementation of change and steering through the necessary mass of procedures and consultation to successful conclusion has fallen to my department's team leaders and in particular to ruth in personnel and training
in parallel with this ann has UNK the establishment of entirely new team budgeting processes and tracy has made sure that staff affected by chance have appropriate space and office facilities to do their jobs
it will be wrong however to conclude that the department's role is entirely directed UNK towards n c v o effectiveness vital though that is
many members will be aware that the professional advice on which n c v o depends is also available to them and other organisations particularly in the areas of legal work personnel finance and office technology we find there is a high demand for advice which we intend to continue to satisfy in the years ahead
as richard has said earlier this is an area on which strategic work will be undertaken in the next couple of years or so
a business as usual approach has also been maintained by n c v o information and technology team under joan
despite the challenge a UNK information services to meet the needs of the new teams and outside users as well as developing a strategy for the completely UNK of our office technology requirements
the implementation programme for which has now begun
i suppose one of the most fundamental changes brought about by reorganisation though was the creation of a team which for the first time UNK into one management structure
all functions relating to enquiries publicity press media production publishing and fund raising
considerable work has been initiated through the medium of a communication strategy and we're delighted that the loss of amanda er many of you will know amanda and will know where she's gone to
this she left at a critical time
that's now been placed in proper context by the arrival of UNK as head of communications as judy said earlier on we're already beginning to enjoy the fruits of her skills in the presentation surely you're seeing today
looking more to the future now again as judy and other colleagues have implied n c v o places high priority on increasing membership supported by effective communications
service development and policy involvement
the services and communication department looks forward to playing an important part in this perhaps starting with the communications seminar this afternoon
given alternative attractions this afternoon though we shall make sure this is not the only opportunity for members to contribute to the debate
finally you'll want to know the significance of the photograph behind me
the UNK readers of the n c v o news will have spotted reference to the fact that we shall be moving offices from next june and of course the treasurer had a fair bit to say about this earlier on
what you're looking at is a representation of a purpose built office of some twenty one thousand square feet near king's cross
it's currently UNK completion
i'm delighted now to be able to inform members that terms have been agreed and the UNK formally under offer and off the market
as many of you will know from first hand experience there are few things which have a greater impact on morale and productivity than the working environment and associated facilities
we now have the challenge of a marvellous opportunity for the physical re establishment of n c v o for years to come in premises which will fully meet the needs both of its staff and the wide range of visitors it attracts
one could quite probably say on this occasion
watch this space
thank you
thank you very much tony
what a UNK exciting point at which to leave us as it were
we've now had i think this very ex exciting very interesting UNK co UNK erm overview of the issues of the work done in the different areas
it's now over to you this is your opportunity
ask questions make comments to enter into the discussion
if you would very kindly state your name and your organisation just for the record
whose going to be the first
is this a is this a good feature to include on this day while you're thinking about it
is this a good idea to have this kind of er presentation to bring you up to date
good
well t well let's have
i'm gi i'm giving them time to think you see
there's someone there
ar please
i just been in loads of workshops
leslie
this afternoon but we won't all be in that workshop sorry just to have perhaps UNK if you'd just say what of the new communications strategy i think members ourselves but in a sense it would be very useful to know what the others perhaps we could take some of it back with us
erm thank you leslie
erm i understand that UNK is actually outside at the moment waiting to meet sir leonard so er would
i was only telling tony
er could we just er wait sh he should be arriving in just five minutes if we could come back to that a later could we
perhaps i can say that what i'd like to see is n c v o be much more corporate in the way it approaches things erm many of you will have seen many of our publications but you may not always realise they come from n c v o sometimes it's not always easy to see that you have to search through and not always find it and we've got many different images so i think it's important we er get a whole corporate image across
but it's also important that we get our message across more effectively and in that we're reflecting your views more effectively
so i think the communications department wanted to pull together all of these issues and make sure that we hear your voice effectively we represent it effectively and that the sense in which n c v o comes over as an organisation is more appropriately presented and projected in all the many different UNK in which we're currently operating
i don't know if that meets your point
th erm there's at the back please
er mick
counselling er and it follows directly from what was said erm judy has referred in her talk about the importance of communications with members and i'm delighted to note that erm the health and disability group is to have a meeting in january to look at a variety of issues including the health work of n c v o this is the first meeting for i think two years and if it new era in communications i for one am delighted
thank you perhaps i can comment on that
i'm keen to see a real dialogue with our members er how we achieve that i don't know we've got the most enormous diversity of membership as i mentioned in my speech but the more that we can get a good dialogue going and certainly i used to be a member of health and erm disability group and remember that it was a very useful meeting point er as well as a good arena for developing policy initiatives
so i hope that we will find ways of UNK involving all of you and perhaps that would be a good start i hope so anyway
thank you very much judy er simon or does any other member of the team
do you wish to add to
no
per perhaps i can just say one point
sometimes we're concerned as to whether n c v o is competing with its membership about what we do and i know that a point has been raised on that er by somebody who i think is present today
we don't see ourselves
i want to see n c v o as co operating
if you as our members are doing something well our role is to support you
if you're doing something well but there are other areas that need to be filled in our role is to compliment you
if many of you are doing something well but you need to be brought together our role is to co UNK you and if you're not doing something and it needs doing then our role is to UNK it
but all the time it is working with you and not in competition with you
thank you very much erm at the back please
erm i would certainly stand up and er share everyone's congratulations of what n c v o's done over the la past year and certainly we've had an enormous amount of help particularly from the rural
but i have been a little concerned th the term equal opportunities hasn't been mentioned once today and i would like a reassurance that it's not because it's year's or the last UNK issue
i would like to know what n c v o currently is doing in a number of ways about equal opportunities
thank you
right may maybe i'll just start and my colleagues can add in i'm UNK the platform as usual
can i say that when i was interviewed for the job of er director or i was asked along with other applicants to put forward a er paper presenting my issues and concerns and i can say to you equal opportunities was a key one there
so i hope there will be other developments going on
but certainly equal opportunities as a part of the integral working of n c v o and we do regularly review how we as an organisation are meeting our equal opportunities requirements across the board that's race sex disability er in involving the staff who are at lower levels and so on
i do that there are some wider responsibilities we need to keep reviewing what we're up to
er the organisation development unit was highly involved with the er abilities and management development of er black organisations
now that they gone independent we've got to again look and see what are our roles there
so it's a continually UNK effort i believe er but i like to have the contribution of some of my colleagues as to what they feel th the roles are
i think one of the reason why you haven't heard it mentioned specifically is because it is integral to a lot of the bits of work that we're doing
just to site some of the bits of work that i was talking about erm the trustee training working party for example er in ha has got on it a representative from the black voluntary sector
we've looked particularly at some of the kinds of er issues that black and ethnic minority groups experience in that area
the mapping we are particularly targeting certain kinds of disadvantaged
the groups in our survey worked to make sure that we look at the needs advice needs that they have and that's brought out
the UNK good management project again has UNK certain kinds of disadvantage organisations to ensure that they're getting funded and that's also reflected in the representation on the committee
so i think you can be assured that it's not something that's been put to one side it's something that we're trying to build in to all the work we do in whatever ways appropriate but er i accept that the implications for your comment that we've got to be continually er watching ourselves to make sure that we do that
thank you richard
simon
yes i was going to add to that slightly and to what judy said in the sense that the implication the question i think is a correct one that every organisation and n c v o wouldn't be immune er than from any other have got to actually ensure that they keep this at the front of their agenda all the time
it's quite right that it should be integrated in all our work programmes rather than it seems as necessarily a UNK erm element or thing
but of course the danger on the other side of the coin if you simply rely on that is that you actually begin to loose focus or you begin to ignore it without meaning to UNK
and i think it's both important for n c v o itself to ensure that it's working on issues equal opportunities issues that affect itself and that it's helping the sector as a whole to do that and we're very conscious of that and er certainly just in the last few weeks have been looking at how we can upgrade what we're doing in that sphere
thank you
can i add to that erm kay by saying that our concentration with within my department
mm
and personnel particularly is on ensuring that n c v os as an organisation is UNK the highest standards around equal opportunities erm our employment records are subject to regular monitoring and we discuss i mean in a brain UNK way various issues that emerge from the figures that we get
so as an organisation we we're very much have an awareness of the need to be UNK in that respect
thank you
angela and i was head of the international department from nineteen forty eight to nineteen seventy two
hello
i have be very interested to hear about the recent developments and most impressed at what's taken place but er i would like to ask about the international work which i understand has been reduced
i feel personally this is a pity now we're coming into europe and er trying to be international but i'm sure there was a very good reason for it and i sh i should like to know what it was
i'm sure they'll UNK to say not reduced just done in a different way but shall i ask
yes
thank you very much for that question i think it is an important one because we looked at our international work as we did at all our work over the period that we were considering reorganisation
and i genuinely would say that i actually think the amount of international and european work going on within the organisation as a whole is now greater than it was before
erm it's certainly true that we reduced the total size of a particular team or unit dealing with international affairs but only on the grounds that we actually felt that it was very important that all the teams should be working on international and european dimensions of their work rather than seeing it as UNK in one area
therefore if i just looked at some of those policy teams that i referred to in my presentation i would expect and it's happening that we would be taking on board in each of those policy teams the policy development work that's applicable to europe
if we take just one example the social and public policy team has therefore policy responsibility for all the work erm from a policy point of view er about the legal structure that might exist in future er european associations that might be created because it matches very clearly our work on charity law UNK
so we're trying to unite the two things together
i think i can assure you we've got a an international european officer who has the main responsibility for opening the doors for us in a lobbying way within europe and in addition to that and the maintenance of the networks we are spreading international and european responsibilities around the organisation so it's seen again to be integral to our work rather than UNK and i'm confident that the organisation as a whole will therefore be doing more
thank you simon UNK any additions to that
no
erm i'd just like to reassure the conference that there is actually a representative erm from a environmental organisation here today after richard erm comments head of communications at friends of the earth erm and also to ask him on what basis erm he made the comment that environmental organisation have a tradition of not working together
erm within friends of the earth staff in the organisation commonly liaise with their counter parts in other environment and development n g os
erm we do work together where we share a common agenda and we find that we share common policy positions and there are a lot discussions that go on about policy questions between environmental n g os erm and also like any n g o that's pressed for time and money we work together where actually it can be justified by the results
erm so really that's an enquiry and also further explanation of the project that is being jointly funded by the d o e and b p
thank you richard
yes i think my comments particularly directed at the regional and local level where i think for quite understandable reasons namely the very rapid development of new environmental organisations er in a lot of areas er we have found that the environmental groups have not er initially been working together
i think that's changing very much
we've seen in a number of areas the development of regional net environmental networks which we have been directly involved in helping develop
and one part of the environmental project is to try and ensure regional environmental networks develop in all parts of the country rather just in those where they currently exist
the other part of the work is based on the experience particularly of councils for voluntary service and other bodies like that who at a local level are providing advice and support to voluntary groups
they found that their links with environmental groups are not very good and also that environmental groups are often not very aware of the kinds of services that a council for voluntary service can provide them
so the object of that part of the project is to try and address that issue to try and make sure that n v UNK build up their links with environmental groups
that the services they provide are relevant to environmental groups and in that way to help environmental groups plug in to the kinds of advice on fund raising and er management and all sorts of other aspects of running a voluntary organisation which at the moment of er a lot of er social service organisations plug into but so many environmental groups
so i just thinks it's a it's a feature of the rapid development of the environmental sector that for as i say for quite understandable reasons some of those links and networks haven't been fully established and our project which we see as a as a short term one essentially a three year bit of work is going to address that and it's been widely supported by er a number of environmental groups
thank you richard
at the back please
i'm nigel i'm chief executive of the national charity community of transport which is based in manchester and it's that last point which is really significant behind my question and it concerns your new premises and i'm one it's a question as to what your planning to do and secondly a request if you're not er that you could provide within that some working space for people from out of town to use when we're in london complete with things like you know coin operated fax machines because i find i spend quite a lot of time in london you have meetings on UNK days you have time to kill and there's no where sort of comfortable to go and sit down and get on with some things
thank you
tony would you comment
i'm delighted to comment though subject to contract and everything else i wouldn't give any assurances
may i say right at the start of the planning processes and we'll start with n c v o's immediate needs but we're very aware of services that other organisation need from time to time and it's very interesting to hear that as a as a new example
er i will be fitting that in our own planning process
there is erm within london in the next fours years or so a major initiative that's being operated under the erm a c e n v o association of chief executives and national voluntary organisations which some of you will know about
a major er development somewhere around eighty to a hundred thousand square feet of resource space for organisations and they will also i think be looking the sort of provision that you suggested
there's no harm however in us looking at that as an option within our own space
thank you very much tony
possibly also worth mentioning er b p's charity base which i think has been a very er good recent initiative whereby there is office sharing accommodation available er and all those sort of services that you talked about so er there is already initiative and i think that seems to be very successful
thank you the last question i'm afraid now
at the back please
my name's alan from the edinburgh council social service to change its name in april to the council of voluntary organisations
i'd like first of all bring UNK north of the border
i think i'm the only representative here and apologies from the director and the chair of the scottish council of voluntary organisations
we had our annual meeting last week and er very successful it was too
i've operated er various positions on the UNK fringe and i could've replied briefly to my colleague from wales in
not
in my UNK welsh i don't have any gaelic i'm afraid
the point i would like to make is that while we're thinking of international relations that we do bear in mind that united kingdom is still a united kingdom
we need to communicate with each other on a regularly basis over all the issues that have been raised
i think this is extremely important
i know it goes on
some of us though working at the ground grass roots ma may not know that it goes on and er i would just like to take this opportunity of UNK how important it is to that we communicate within the united kingdom and er support UNK er suggestion that it would be useful to have a base down here
he and i were at a lobby at the house of commons yesterday in er celebration of the mobility allowance which UNK very successfully and we in the community transport field have very close working relationships and communication
so there's an example of where it's happening and i hope it will happen over the whole field
thank you
th thank you very much and i'm sure we send UNK equally north of the border
sadly i think that our time has run out for this particular session but i would remind you that the seminars this afternoon erm are offer other opportunities to explore both some of the issues that have been raised er through your questions now and also others that you may wish to raise er with the members of staff the leaders of the groups
i would before passing on the next part of our programme i would like to UNK thank judy and simon and richard and tony not only for their presentations their carefully thought out presentations to give us as broad a span as possible of how they see the priorities what is happening at this time but for everything else they do in leading their teams and UNK so many of the UNK that take place which adds so much as has been said by both by judy and by other speakers to carry n c v o forward
we are enormously fortunate as our chairman said in his video presentation erm to have such devoted loyal and committed staff and i think you can see that in the quality of the work which comes out of n c v o and the way in which it moves forward always sort of going towards er taking with it the members
so thank you very much indeed and we now move on to briefly to earlier on our UNK in our programme we received that tony could not be with us today but we are delighted to welcome in his place sir leonard i b UNK director of personnel and corporate services
sir leonard has had a distinguished with i b m which included being seconded by i b m to the national health service management board first as director of personnel and then as chairman of the board
he holds a number of UNK is a member of learned UNK an author is a UNK of many awards and UNK and hold many offices including some as chairman in a wide range of organisations including some in the voluntary sector and many concerned with education and training
the title of his address to us today voluntary organisations and the private sector is a subject of enormous interest to this audience and it seems particularly appropriate with the wide and distinguished experience of our speaker
sir leonard
well thank you very much chair for that splendid introduction i'm sure my mother would recognise me from er what you said
good morning ladies and gentlemen can i just give you er tony apologies er unfortunately he has to be in paris today i know he'd prefer to be with you but he has to be in paris today and since he's good at delegation he's actually asked me to come along and to talk to you
erm i suppose i have one advantage which is i know one or two people in the audience and i think i know a little bit about the nature of the audience er and you gathered why from er the UNK introduction
but er that's a great advantage when compared with the newly appointed british UNK in washington who having just arrived in washington er picked up the telephone and heard a voice at the other end say what do you want for christmas it was just before christmas what do you want for christmas and he thought UNK and didn't want to be UNK or too greedy so he said a small box of UNK fruit and put the telephone down and a few UNK a few moments later he put on the radio and the UNK said we've just conducted our normal review of the UNK wishes for christmas er the UNK in washington
and the german UNK wants peace on earth and good will to all men
and the french UNK wants the release of remaining hostages in UNK and the british UNK wants a small box wants a small box of UNK fruit
so i have that advantage that er i do know a little bit about you
erm and i also understand that this is the first time you've actually had someone from the private sector er whose been invited to er address your a g m so i'd like to thank you for the privilege and for also for the opportunity to speak on a subject which i personally er find of great interest
a politician once said
er ask a fellow to speak on something that interests him and you're sure to get a more interesting speech
and i'm about to test that
as the role of er business in the community is well at the top of personal agenda in my job as i b m personnel director and director of corporate affairs the corporate affairs bit er is the piece i'm going to be talking about
erm well i er i hope that er i can prove that politician right today
let me straight away er that it might be UNK of me to assume that er you know a great deal about i b m by the way i b m stands for international business machines not as some people used to think international UNK missiles
erm and i b m is of course very well known in the computer field
i b m u k which UNK its UNK anniversary this year has some sixteen thousand employees based in some fifty two locations throughout the united kingdom and they're working on all aspects of information technology er from software to UNK from UNK to personal systems and of course we form part of a very large company i b m corporation which UNK around three hundred and seventy thousand people across the world
now some of you here today might wonder what a computer company has to do with the community
er you may quite UNK regard businessmen like myself with some suspicion
how can people whose daily life involves this UNK pursuit of profit possibly understand the motives of organisations like your own
organisations dedicated to providing support to minority groups to the disabled to the under privileged to the under UNK or people who simply don't have the means to get the advice and support which they need
let me assure you straight away then i see absolutely no conflict between having moral values and running a profit making business
UNK do have a place in the UNK and our employees er employees in i b m would expect them to have that place
companies are made up of hundred of individual citizens who may depend on the support services of the voluntary sector
for instance in the case of marriage guidance UNK counselling advice on debt and so on
they therefore expect the companies they work for to support the providers of those services in some way and they want to play their part too in delivering those services and i have quite a lot to say about that later on
but today i want to address three themes that UNK around relationships
first the relationship between public private and voluntary sectors which i do believe need to work more closely together
secondly the relationships between the private sector and the voluntary sector and lastly how we measure the success of these special relationships
well my view and it's a view shared by many business leaders is that for business to continue to be the wealth UNK in our society a healthy balanced community in which to operate is essential
the private sector therefore need the support of an educated employed and motivated community as much as the community needs the support of industry and commerce and when i'm asked whether in these harsh economic times business can still afford to support the community
my reply is that we cannot afford not to do so
UNK increasing it's not just a question of support it's a committed partnership and as the boundaries between public private and voluntary sectors become less rigid these partnerships will continue to grow
and i'm sure you need no reminding that during the past ten years a new order has emerged and is emerging which is changing the roles traditionally per performed by the three sectors
for example with the creation of hospital trusts with the opting out of schools with the contracting out of local government services
i would certainly advocate the existence of more UNK where the three sectors can come together to achieve mutual understanding and where c we can debate this new order and make joint decisions about its future
what about the relationships specifically between the private and the voluntary sectors
the u k's voluntary sector is large its turnover is estimated at about seventeen billion
which incidentally makes it larger than agriculture
the voluntary sector therefore has an enormous role to play in all our lives and investing in it is essential for the long term future of commerce and industry for without it the UNK would not would not set and cracks would appear throughout our society
an investment i repeat investment is the key word here
as i said last year at the UNK and company conference on employee UNK
we regard expenditure in the community as being in a par with expenditure in any other sphere of business activity and subject to the same management disciplines
it is investment like any other business investment and it should be clear what it is intended to achieve and how this is to be measured
this is a view shared by about three hundred leading companies including i b m who belong to the per cent club
members of that club see private sector involvement in the community as an integral part of corporate life which can improve both business itself and the relationship between business sector and the community as a whole
qualifications for the per cent club which was launched by the prince of wales in nineteen eighty six is the contribution of no less than half a per cent of pre tax u k profits or one per cent of dividends to the community
the aims of the per cent club were described by the archbishop of canterbury at the clubs at the clubs annual general meeting last week as clear and UNK
he said impressed by the growing co operation between so many businesses and their local communities
it is the wealth UNK he said who open up the great possibilities for improvement in our society
community investment which without UNK er i can say is a phrase UNK by i b m is seen to be of strategic importance to many leading companies
a major plank of our community investment strategy is to work in partnership with the voluntary sector at both national and local levels and forgive me if i use i b m to UNK in setting up the north east environmental initiative in partnership with the ground work trust business in the community and UNK borough council
the UNK aim is to encourage children in schools to think about the environment and involve producing an environmental teaching pack running an environmental course for teachers and developing a green software application for us on personal computer in schools
now let me talk a little bit about policies
i b m u k has long established policies for managing its corporate social responsibility and as i said earlier applies the same principles to this as to any other business activity
thus we've never considered it right to hand out cheques on a mere UNK deciding to sponsor a project or support a charity because it happened to be the flavour of the month or because a director had some particular keen interest in it
last year we gave four point four million either in kind or in people's time not including er that that's UNK or erm in money er and er it sounds a lot of money but you can easily get rid of that sum when you're receiving so many requests
so it's im particularly important to target it and to make sure that there is some impact as a result of that expenditure
so our support has been subject to UNK guidelines as you'd expect from any efficient organisation
recently we've come to think er even more UNK about the projects and organisations we've chosen to support for of course two reasons
first this more systematic approach has left rather less room for doubt when making decisions about contributions when one gets so many applications and second the recession has forced us to look more carefully at how potential new investments might meet company objectives as well as the needs of the community
notice it's not altruism i'm arguing very clearly as self interest in the activity
i'm sure this strategic approach is appreciated and understood by organisations such as yourselves who prefer the closer working relationship which follows this kind of support
what do we bring to this partnership for the voluntary sector
our most obvious support is through cash donations but often it's much more than that
we bring the time of our people resources in kind and skills and expertise
employment UNK of the voluntary sector is one of the fo one of the four er basic areas which we define for support er against their background of er of targeting
now by UNK we mean we mean enabling we mean helping the voluntary sector to be more UNK effective and efficient in the use of its UNK resources
so that is a very clear objective that we have as one of our contributions
we do this in several ways including for example our creative management skills course which won a national training award in nineteen eighty eight and which we make available of course to managers within the voluntary sector
and in addition the i b m fund for com community computing which was launched by john the minister of state at the home office earlier this year
we've been running the management skills courses since nineteen eighty six and since then more than seven hundred and fifty people from groups such as yours have taken a part and we're about to launch a phase two in the next er year or so
it offers practical advice on team work time and task management leadership and delegation the motivation of others and many other topics
there can be no doubt that this course has UNK the management skills of some of those working in the voluntary sector but an extra benefit is that it had UNK the links between i b m and you and UNK the understanding between both of us
the fund for community computing i mentioned earlier is aimed at helping voluntary and community organisations to use information technology more efficiently
many organisations as i'm sure you are aware buy computer or receive them as gifts but they don't make full use of them because of the lack of money for the necessary training and consultancy
the fund will provide grants for up to a thousand pounds for these organisations to spend on such training
another way in which we is by encouraging and UNK employee UNK
i b m is just one of many companies who now feel that lending employees rather than giving money is a better way to work with a voluntary sector
one of the main UNK for community involvement is what has become known in i b m as the ten per cent scheme
this enables our employees to use the equivalent of one afternoon a week during working hours for approved community activities always of course subject to workload
and many of employees are involved in voluntary groups education and training the arts and charities in of course their own spare time
in fact our office in edinburgh last week won a major u k award for employee UNK
the award was presented by the prince of wales at the annual meeting of the per cent club which i've already mentioned and it was during nineteen ninety and it won the private sector small to medium size company or companies subsidiary sector category
incidentally much of its work was done in support of the UNK advice UNK erm in which it helped develop er computer applications and also it had the courage to organise a major aids conference
you will i'm sure some of you will be familiar with the drugs aids problem which exists in edinburgh
by the way the overall winner so i don't make it too i b m was of course body shop international
one of the reasons i b UNK edinburgh office won the award was the enthusiasm of the employees
and this was also why l e a t l e a t our local environment action teams initiative proved to be so outstanding
l e a t was designed to encourage employees and their families to undertake voluntary work to improve the environment
employees were awarded sums of money between a hundred pounds and fifteen thousand pounds to tackle projects in partnership with national or local voluntary organisations
when the scheme was announced the need for individual as well as corporate action was UNK by tony
in this area and others we support it's the individuals which a company's role in the community so well received
individual co
additional responsibility
we look forward very much to his succession to the chair and we wish him very well and i know that he can count on the full support of all the honorary officers and all of you as members of the council as he takes on these new responsibilities
so i gather that jeffrey would like to say a word or two and at this stage and if he would he would be welcome to do so meanwhile er as i've said i hope you will join me in wishing er the bishop god speed and in wishing jeffrey very well for the future
mr chairman ladies and gentlemen it isn't that i would like to say a word it is that told me to say a word and i realise i am starting off in the right way
may i say how deeply honoured i am to be invited to chair n c v o i am UNK conscious with a degree of UNK and indeed UNK that i face a huge challenge in following in alan's UNK
you would anyhow not expect on this occasion any words of wisdom from me indeed my wife and four daughters would UNK tell you that you should never expect words of wisdom from me
so may i simply say briefly but nonetheless with emphasis and UNK two things
first that i believe the causes you serve are vital to the welfare and happiness of people in this country and that they will become more so in future
and secondly that i will do my UNK to serve you and those causes to the best of my ability
very well i'll let's just then move on to resolution number thr three as printed on your order paper
i don't propose to go right er through it
i once UNK at somebody may remember a sort of constitutional commission as it was UNK called which we went through all these things with a tooth UNK in order to try to get the composition of the executive committee er right and appropriate for er this current time
so let me UNK myself simply to inviting erm penny to propose the resolution
those are mine my you can come to this one if you will
it gives me pleasure to move the adoption of resolution three that the executive committee be UNK as on page two of the resolution paper to consist of not more than thirty two members and that those people listed on page two be elected members of the executive committee
i'd also like to add a great thanks to the retiring executive committee for all the hard work that they've done during the past year
thanks
and paula if she will to second the resolution
i'm happy to commend all these names to the meeting and to second the resolution
is er are there any comments or questions that any member of the council would wish to put forward before we vote on this resolution
alright then er it has been proposed and seconded and er those in favour
and those against
very well that is carried certainly UNK con quite possibly unanimous although it's rather hard to see into the far corners
erm so we come to special resolution number one which is as set out on your order paper which is to do with the replacement of a er clause in our memorandum of association and i will invite jeffrey to move it
thank you
there are er two special resolutions this year and they both relate to our investment powers
erm we set up an investment panel of the erm the executive committee to specifically to look in detail at our investment policy in the light of resolution four at the nineteen eighty seven a g m we've met with our investment advisors on several occasions and we have considered our in investment policy in some detail
we propose to establish a an investment charter which will set out our policy and in particular balance the duties of us as trustees
our duty is to secure the best return we possibly can or on our investments and yet at the same time to have regard to the aims and objectives of the council itself
we've made some progress towards establishing the criteria which we should set out in our policy and the mechanisms needed to control that policy
however we have i'm sorry to say identified two constraints in our powers and we cannot make further progress until these constraints have been removed
we need to deal with these constraints by special resolutions which will amend our memorandum of association
the first constraint relates to the range of investments which are available to us as trustees
at present we're limited by the powers available under the trustee investment acts nineteen sixty one this sets out the amounts which we may invest in narrow and wide ranges of investment
in general terms the narrow range of investments are fairly very safe and secure investments but they are ones which are less likely to secure higher returns but of course also less likely to secure risks of low returns
the wider range is erm what might be termed more speculative investments but there are many shares available within the wider range which are in fact extremely sound and safe investments and the sort which we as trustees would wish to invest in
now at the moment we have to keep fifty percent of our investments in the narrow range and we may place fifty percent in the wider range
i have to say though that when we the council advise other charities on the investment powers that they should take when they're established and when they draft their memorandum of association erm we advise them to take wider powers er than these and we advise them that they should not seek to UNK themselves by the trustee investment act nineteen sixty one as our own flexibility is constrained
the result of this constraint on us is that it reduces our opportunity to secure the best returns available
there are better returns available from wider range investments than from narrow range investments and better returns without unnecessarily increasing our risks
secondly the constraint reduces the opportunity that we have to pursue the ethical investment policies which will have regard to the aims and objectives of the council as a whole and then lastly there is the matter of UNK
erm since the wider range investments on the whole tend to increase in value more rapidly than the UNK range investments then as the investments in the normal course of management are bought and sold the proportion which you have invested in the wider range tends to increase faster than the proportion that you have invested in the UNK range
we therefore would need to do some quite careful accounting in order to make sure that we didn't UNK that erm the requirement of the trustee investment act in the future
so we wish therefore to remove this first constraint on our powers and i'd emphasise again that it is our intention to use it's not our intention to use the wider powers to increase the risks it's simply to improve er our ability to gain the best returns and satisfy the objectives of the council
the trustees will still be bound by a duty to act UNK and in the best interests of the council and its members
i therefore move the first special resolution
thank you is erm david here
i've rather doubt that he might not be and then bert er has very kindly said that he would erm stand in for him to second this resolution
i formally second the resolution chairman
thank you
erm well i think that er the report of these er resolutions and er of this resolution and er so er but there may be questions or comments on it so no alright then er let me put it to you
that is special resolution number one on your order paper be approved
those in favour
those UNK
none
thank you
would you like then to go on erm jeffrey to special resolution number two
it's a kind of UNK resolution to the one that you have just passed
thank you
the trustees in acting UNK on investments need to take advice and we have done so for many years and our investment advisors are currently UNK investment management limited
under the financial services act a number of provisions have been passed to protect investors erm and n c v o as an investor also comes under the protection of the financial services act
one particular requirement of the act is that there should be a management agreement between the investors and the investment advisors
this management agreement is to formally set out the relationship between them to establish the investment policies to be pursued the powers of the trustees or the investors and the investment advisors to establish clearly the fees and charges which are to be made by the advisors and the basis on which they will be made
to establish how the advisors shall report on their activities to the investors and to set out any other conditions which the investors may wish to establish
the financial services act also requires for a body such n c v o that their memorandum of association should actually include an explicit power to use investment advisors
this second special resolution is designed to enable us to comply with that requirement of the financial services act
there are however a number of UNK in that resolution
in particular the resolution requires that we the trustees should establish clear policy guidelines and the investment panel i hope will very shortly be able to do that
secondly it requires that all transactions made on our behalf shall be reported promptly i would emphasise that this is already the practice the investment tr er transactions are already reported to our finance department and trustees of course must sign the necessary transfer forms
thirdly there is a power for the trustees to UNK or amend the agreement at any time
and then lastly there is an obligation on us to review at least annually the position of our advisors
as you know we meet with our advisors at least twice a year and we effectively review that erm that agreement at those six month points
but we may also in the future wish to review it more formally and consider what other er arrangements we might make
so i would emphasise then again that the resolution is intended to enable the present position to continue and to enable your trustees to manage the funds effectively in setting the policy and UNK from the advice which is available
i therefore move the second special resolution
thank you jeffrey
perhaps mr spencer would UNK again erm by seconding this resolution
i formally second the resolution chairman
right thank you
erm now any comments or UNK or questions or whatever er on this resolution
resolution number special resolution two as printed on your order papers
just to say
i was afraid that everyone had lost their voices er it's good to have a question
yes this is a question on the er resolution two item five
it talks about the council remaining liable
er is the council or is it the trustees remain liable i'm unclear on that point
perhaps jeffrey would like to deal with that or adrian
i think er joe it might be more appropriate perhaps if our legal advisor tells us of the UNK of the clause which he drafted
right adrian
gentlemen this is a clause based on a provision recommended by the charity commission
the answer here is a very technical one but the trustees of an organisation of this kind are of course the executive committee
they're the directors in company law but they're the executive committee names in the memorandum of association
they're also the charity trustees and i think it would be true to say that in the very final analysis they are the people who are ultimately responsible
does that erm meet your point
yes i believe that actually it should be the responsibility of the officers of an association to take the responsibility
they are reported to they define the policy and i don't believe that it's the intention of the executive committee to come to this meeting every time there's a change of investment policy
i don't believe that would be the practice and therefore i believe the executive committee as the trustees and UNK on our behalf in this matter should take the responsibility and i would have preferred the trustees rather than the council to have been stated at that point
jeffrey adrian
if as i understand it it's a matter of law and the practice will be much as just suggested is that a correct er interpretation
so i think your point is in effect met but we have to observe very properly the requirements of the law
right erm any other comments or suggestions on special resolution number two
very well may i put it to you that this special resolution be adopted
those in favour and those against
thank you er and that is passed
now we have er erm reached the conclusion of the formal part of the this annual general meeting
at the next session will be UNK by kay and er she will tell us what she is about as it were erm in a moment
before that there are one or two other things i should like to do er in particular to thank UNK telecom for their UNK part sponsorship of this meeting
they're very much involved with UNK community care to use their own phrase and those of you who want to know more about them they've got a stall outside and er their UNK so to say are set out for you to see
erm otherwise it remains only to say thank you very much for coming i hope you've found the experience helpful
i'm grateful to you for your UNK to fall in with the proposals made and er i have enjoyed the opportunity to chair this a g m the meeting is now concluded
it is for people properly funded by a democratic enabling local state and under con the control of those who have no pecuniary interest in the development of care
voluntary organisations er can do this and are in the best place to undertake this
of course we must be cautious about taking on difficult tasks as if to prove our social UNK
this was put well by diana and her colleagues in a policy studies institute report a couple of years ago
voluntary organisation they said in their desire for recognition and funds sometimes seem all too willing to UNK with the statutory sector on the basis that they can do the impossible but miracles take a little longer
voluntary organisations as diana and her colleagues said should have the confidence to suggest that although under the right conditions and with the right resources er they may be able to do the impossible miracles are not on offer
the UNK state would provide those resources to in to do what perhaps has been traditionally seen as the impossible but it will require extensive support
health authorities and local authorities must be encouraged to come to see the necessity of providing local umbrella groups such as councils for voluntary service with grant aid to develop industrial relations expertise er marketing help p r help and so on
if not voluntary organisations may be able to obtain some of those from the private sector if they know where to look
perhaps c v UNK can act as er UNK for relevant professional services
but the important thing is that the voluntary sector must UNK the trends from the old UNK to the new UNK and steer it into a better way
we've got to be pro active about this it's no good simply sitting back and waiting for whatever government is in power to impose certain regulations certain restrictions certain proposals
from being mainly UNK established we must see the development of new UNK organisations meeting specific needs
statutory agencies will have to use a UNK mixture of grant and contract to help set up new organisations run by the community for the community to create the range and choice required by consumers
the voluntary sector i believe must accept those developments whilst at the same time demanding effective regulation and monitoring to create a managed community market
although some of the worst fears of those who dislike the market UNK can be UNK there is no doubt that complete freedom of competition particularly in social care will not work
this strategy requires a major change in the way voluntary organisations perceive themselves and the way local and central government UNK the community
some of the trends are already there others need to be encouraged
none of it will be easy
the voluntary sector though has a greater role to play now than ever before both as advocate and service provider
they will need extensive support from n c v o and other groups er to be able to undertake that task
if central and local government are serious in their intent to create choice and UNK what i would call welfare UNK in health and social care then they must also take seriously the need to support voluntary organisations trying to meet those aspirations
by and large i do not believe that people want for profit organisations running human service delivery
indeed i don't believe the private sector can get into the community in the way that er not for profit UNK organisations can
what we need is to get the best of both UNK an enhanced and more competent community providing care support and help to individuals efficiently but without dumping disadvantaged people onto UNK relatives
there is of course an opportunity to use money currently locked up in large institutions and statutory organisations more UNK through local effort
that is the challenge for local government
the current government must recognise that it cannot continue to go down the line of an UNK anxiety UNK state of competitive individuals where the poor and disabled are left to UNK on city streets
on the other hand labour and other opposition parties cannot just UNK the old UNK about public funding of public production
whichever of the two main parties forms the government of the early nineteen nineties it will have to create a greater consensus in health and social care as well as other areas of our national life
not only that but a UNK consensus morality is also required
the voluntary sector is probably the only vehicle by which that dialogue can take place
i believe the voluntary sector is on the UNK of massive change there will be those who cannot cope and will UNK back to the old authoritarian days of small grants and UNK with the chair of social services
there will be those who just cannot get into gear who will watch the private sector take over many of the functions which have been previously been run by local government
but there will be those who will grab the trends and steer them into a new direction
the scope for the voluntary sector and not for profit activity in the nineteen nineties is immense it will not be expansion just for its own sake but UNK activity aimed to make the most of opportunities on behalf of the community
being of the community can assist in UNK the community to provide better services and support for disadvantaged and disabled people
er at the same time the voluntary sector can assist in developing a new shared morality
a highest common factor of our collective conscience
nothing less will do
thank you
well i'm not sure how you follow that exciting challenges persuasive ideas sound strategic proposals for the future not to mention a word with which not all of us may be entirely familiar and i include myself among them UNK
er we have set questions on the agenda and chris i think we've time
yes just for a few questions if you've gathered your thoughts together
there's so much in what chris has said is there not that we i'm so pleased that your address is going to be published because i feel that it's something we shall want to have and to take back to our organisations
so would anyone like to ask a question of chris
would you like to say who you represent please
my name's UNK and i'm for director for a group exploring UNK
i suppose my first experience is one of immense frustration because i think this is very important document that you bring to us but the speed and the sound being the loud sound of delivery made it very difficult to stay with the concept and ideas
so i would first urge that we get that paper out to us as soon as possible
thank you chris would you like to comment
yes first of all er is this is er on
i'm sorry if it was to difficult to follow either because of the UNK or
it was so loud
was it i am sorry
erm also i wanted to try and cover the main points and it's very difficult with a subject like that to only give you part of the story otherwise people would immediately say well yes but you haven't thought about this or that
i'm quite sure you'll still say that but erm because it is er it's in a sense it's complex
i think to erm very briefly to answer your point erm i believe that the quotes contract culture which is around at the moment has missed out a major component which is concerned with community development and community enhancement
erm and i think that's very important
there's this tendency to suggest that there are these providers out there that will provide
that health authorities and local authorities can simply tender and contract with the people there and they're not there
or if they are there they're existing voluntary organisations which may be already very loaded who've got a lot of work to do to get into a negotiating framework and so on so the first the thing i'd say in answer to you is that n c v o and other must put a tremendous pressure on government and local authorities to fund the community development aspect of the UNK society which er the current government seems to want
erm secondly we will only be able to do that effectively and this is the point you were making about say erm school governors and so on if people really feel they do have some genuine power locally it must be about enabling and UNK local groups to have power and take part within their community
because so many of the people who so many people at the moment feel i think that they have very little real influence and that's why people don't turn up it's why people don't vote for local government
erm and what i'm interested in is how we can through local democratic channels create true UNK of the community
a community which is then in a position to provide care and support within the community properly funded by local government so it becomes a UNK
but it does require that the local er organisations feel genuinely UNK and that's a major challenge for local government
thank you very much i'm sure there's a debate within that we can all continue and i hope we will continue because it's so important
er ray sir ray
whenever i hear chris i'm UNK for three quarters of the time and UNK for the other quarter
erm could i take a couple of points
erm first the UNK one is semantic
the problem about the word UNK is that the french have pinched it
it means being a good member of the community in europe so i don't think that horse is going to run
but if what it means is to combine a sense of community a sense of society a sense of inter dependent provision and UNK in doing it and in providing true welfare con UNK the government have chosen the word partnership
now i think it's in alice in UNK that it is said that words mean what i intend them to mean
can't we build on the word partnership and make it mean what you want
i think it's the nearest we'll get to it and it's in the white paper and it can be used in exactly the sense that i gather you would like it to be used in the discussions we have on the results of the scrutiny and that would be the starting point there
the second point is being totally in favour of you're selling your book
do you in it go a little further in exploring the criteria which should UNK who does what
starting one UNK with who does what best to get away from the sense of the government imposing a UNK on expenditure
that's perhaps enough
yes thank you
erm two points the first on partnership
i don't believe i don't want to impose a particular word and if UNK is a difficulty then i accept that
er it was the best word that i felt i could use at this time it may be that a if a debate UNK from this or from er other er writings about of myself and other people over this next few months that a term will emerge that people feel happy with but certainly we are talking about community partnership
we are talking about erm enabling and UNK and the enhancement of community and i think those are the terms which really matter
how erm er and i think as you're saying what word we put round that almost doesn't matter as long as it's understood to mean that erm that range of concepts and requirements
in relation to your second question about criteria er i do say something about that i do try to erm UNK that out to some extent but it is of course a difficult one
erm in many ways one could say that the community or community organisations local organisations are capable of running most things erm indeed they did at once and some of those functions were taken over by the central or local state
if we go back forty five years social work erm housing was all provided by voluntary agencies or private agencies and not necessarily by the state
erm and so but we do need to do that and i believe the work that you have been doing erm i don't know when that's to be published er but will i'm sure assist us in developing the criteria which will help voluntary organisations to decide what they properly should be doing
i think perhaps the most important thing is that voluntary agencies should do what they believe is right and not allow their own objectives to be distorted simply because a of particular UNK which is why i'm saying let us grab the agenda and write the agenda rather than have the agenda set for us by other people
thank you
thank you very much
i think er we just have er time for one very brief question if you would please
i think yes
UNK representing help the aged or at least representing myself in responding to chris UNK address but er here for help the aged today
can i identify with the objective of UNK can i also share your concept that the voluntary sector is the UNK within which that sort of discussion should be and can be taking place
but can i suggest it's probably a lot more difficult to get there than you were describing even with the various points that you were raising in your address this morning because i wonder if it is fair for all of us to accept the immediate UNK between the voluntary sector whatever we actually mean by that and good community institutions community thinking community awareness
it seems to me that an awful lot of the voluntary sector does come from very much the UNK side of the equation which you were laying out in front of us chris
you probably remember erm a UNK little book published last year by frank on the UNK to UNK where certainly in his nineteenth century analysis of the growth of UNK he saw to main things UNK which er meant that people were going out looking for UNK and therefore doing good social work on the way and the growth of the women's movement in the sense that women otherwise unemployed were looking for a new area of activity to get into
both of those UNK are very much part of UNK they're very much linked with the concept of the active citizen and there are still lots of voluntary organisations that form and which continue and which are existing today which stem entirely from people's desire to go out there and do something in their own way
so that is a very individual strand
another strand of our present voluntary sector are the self help groups which of course are also going to be extremely individual and one third point madam chairman the development of not for profit companies and things like that could also have a very individual strand to them as well since they sound a little bit like our existing small business sector under a community name
thank you
i don't think i'd quite UNK that as brief question but thank you to your contribution to the discussion
chris would you like to respond quite briefly
yes i can probably give you a brief answer because er in that you've raised a whole host of other things erm which erm er we need to we need to think about and debate and i hope we'll have further occasions to do so
er i just the main point
i do think there are problems and difficulties i don't think it will be easy not least because we don't have a shared morality and a shared consensus on the objectives for the voluntary sector but it is a set of concerns which we must address er and i believe that if i've done nothing else today i've kicked off a debate or i've contributed to a debate which was already rolling erm and that we must address those difficulties and try and find ways through them because there are opportunities as well as threats in the current situation and i believe we have to look at all of those er so that we can move into the nineteen nineties which i believe will be a very exciting period for the voluntary sector and one which the voluntary sector should er see as exciting grab the opportunities and move forward
thank you very much chris
i think erm the address we have just heard is a most valuable contribution to the series of the sir george lectures and i'm delighted that you were available and you were willing to do this
i think all the many ideas which have been proposed the challenging thoughts they will make a most enormous contribution to the discussions which we all will be having and i think not only ourselves in the voluntary sector but those elsewhere also
because as you so rightly say we are part of that partnership of that er movement forward but there are other partners too and we want to take them forward with us
so thank you very much indeed for your contribution i think we've all found this a most interesting finish to the a g m of the n c v o
are there any announcements about lunch and things like that
no
oh UNK lunch is served outs outside and erm you all have had details of your special interest meetings both the time and location please make sure you check those on the notice board outside
thank you
right as far as i'm concerned we've completed the first four points on the agenda right
yeah
point five is under your name what's that all about
right well just that er it's been resolved a bit since i handled it cos er got this meeting set up which i don't know whether you need to come it's on the second of february
yeah
and we're going to discuss er the likes of and myself and stuart er how we're gonna allocate the national accounts and who's gonna do what and just clarify
what accounts and whose portfolio
yeah
are you asking me whether i wanna be in there
i was just mentioning it to you in case you wanted to
don't wanna
no you can sort it out between yourselves can't you
yeah so that was that
i just wanted to actually sort of mention it to so that he knows cos he's obviously invited to come if he wants to
i don't think there's going to be any dramatic changes
well he should be there if you're there he should be there
yeah exactly
well just tell him to be there
yeah okay
you and yeah
yeah and new people if they're on board
they won't be there by the second
no way
so that was just that one er nineteen ninety three
so is that is that point five gone is it yeah
yeah only because it's
well you do have clearly define it you don't want yourself
got er got an agenda here
the key issue is really the UNK isn't it
yeah
about how far down we go and how far up UNK goes
done this agenda where she wants where we need to discuss allocation of non national accounts national accounts regional accounts special offers plans for nineteen ninety
i think that one of the most confusing aspects is this word UNK what's a national account corporate what's a national account
i went in to two UNK yesterday er and erm who are a massive potential for us right in where we need to be
i actually put a deal forward to
well i didn't yeah well we may have done
we agreed didn't we no we agreed i thought we agreed that where
that head office was in
no where erm the multiple concern who looked after that business where their national account department looked after that corporate we would look after it and where their key account department looked after it you would look after it and is a national account for erm
i remember that at one of the meetings yeah
is it
yeah so erm
the sales rep shouldn't have called on because that's a
that's easy to say gary but where's the UNK where's the lists that tell people these things
this is the grey area we didn't call on the company we called on the UNK and i hope we haven't done any damage but what we have done and what the p
and these things move from time to time as well of course
yeah i know but nothing's happened since that time to change what we originally agreed
yeah but i mean i don't clearly remember an agreement like that meself and does
i'm sure that was agreed at one of our meetings
well might do but i think it needs to be put in writing you know like who's is who's what you know
well we can start off with the top one hundred companies and allocate them like that if you want if it makes things easier rather
depends on where the head office is doesn't it
well no the top one hundred companies isn't a guide to anything at all
what you mean top one hundred f t s e companies you mean
half of them don't even travel
no i know but it can be a UNK
well the best guide is the one that's in the travel weekly that UNK er
yeah but UNK that's but half of them don't travel
oh you mean the business travel world magazine
yes that has
yeah that's useful no i think i think er it should be a national corporate account the definition of a national corporate account it one that is multi locational throughout the country
yes exactly yeah
that's the only definition and worth over x million pound or whatever total revenue or whatever their UNK is
it's not throughout the length and UNK of the country it's only in my patch
i agree i agree
the other grey area which
cos in point cos that's only in your area innit
yeah as far as i know
unclear
no because passed it over to us that's why i had to go and see the guy if you remember
yeah well mar was un got the impression perhaps wrongly now that it was a national account by virtue of where the allocations were
well can we make it a clear definition please because national means national in terms of agents and UNK means multi locational and all represented
is multi locational doesn't just have one branch
yeah but it only has norwich and it has UNK doesn't that's it isn't it
yeah those are the two big ones
well that falls in region so it's a regional account in my respect
yeah but it's dealt with by the national account department back in
UNK to i don't care less about
this is where the grey areas comes in
well i mean i don't care how they define their descriptions
we have to define ours separately
no we said that's how we were going to define us erm define it i UNK remember that being said it would be defined
yes but
things may change now but we've working on that basis
we can't we can't be driven by the definition that they work
no but that's what we agreed before
well if we did
unclear
no i thought we agreed
i don't remember that i've never seen it on any minutes
i'm gonna pull out the minutes cos we did have a meeting we had a meeting at which was present and that's how we defined it
oh well it was not a meeting that i was at then
no well you said you don't want to be involved in the meetings anyway
well i wasn't there either was i
well that's true but what i'm saying now is UNK i think national is national it's multi locational and it across boundaries right if it's confined within the southern region therefore it's
if it's even lower than that it's local and it's area
i'm not sure no i'm not sure i agree with that because i mean area goes right up to birmingham from the south and it be made multi regional multi locational accounts within southern england and london which are big accounts
what happens if we get one of the national agencies who's located in the opposite part to where the majority of the erm the business from the multi location commercial account is
there's no point my people working
a certain part of i beg your pardon sorry i'm getting my definitions wrong may be looking after something which the erm corporate locations are solely within the south but it's handled by an corporate account
now surely that comes under or through
no it doesn't matter what the travel agent is when you're talking to the corporate
the basis of our decision before was my people work very closely say take with the national account people in right and the main objective there is to get as much business from the corporate accounts as they're responsible for like or whoever
if they're split you can't have people from the field going into dealing with national account managers when my people are also dealing with them
that's the basis
that's what's caused the grey area
yeah that's not that's where it's changed
well that is actually a problem from you know
cos you got
well the national account what you are saying is the national account if the work's for is then responsible for all those accounts that happen to be from the national account manager
that's what that's what i thought we agreed
well no i thought we agreed that if it was in the southern boundaries the locations it doesn't matter what were
you can have that frank you can't have several different sales reps going into seeing different people and my people seeing them as well
you need one central point for each of the UNK
yeah well this is what's not i mean we don't know who those accounts are that you're dealing with where that's the situation
well you c i can get a list of all the corporate accounts that and have and we can go through them one by one
yeah
we can't have people crossing over
main problem at the moment is that they want one person to deal cos at the moment we've got us dealing with national account and we've got dealing with the regional account managers and sales execs dealing with the individual branches and i think things are getting lost as it goes from one to the other
it's a question of whether we adapt to their structure or we have our own structure
mm
isn't it that's the question
the other area was er the area of er tour operators and allocations because as you know holidays was not one of your accounts and we UNK in there only to find that they'd got allocations and business was
yeah the reason that happened was that there was no one servicing holidays erm and they came to us for an allocation and we gave it to them
had somebody been in there to see they would've spoken to them
well no i mean
it's account isn't it
there was no one covering that area
well
yeah if there's no one covering that area then i have to make arrangements for that to be covered which i will do and that will be
i don't think
well it seems like we've got the wires crossed in one or two areas
i think the UNK been is the UNK been is that we don't want to let any business go
and if it comes to us we take it on board means we'll be short of people
which is not a bad thing
yeah well quite
i'm not trying to cast any blame here but handed over allocations on UNK to at one time yeah and left us to carry the ball cos she sort of UNK at one time
yes well i understand so on board
well er just hang on a minute i think
that's what she
you've got a meeting for the second have you
well can you sort that out amongst yourself and then after you've done that then present it to the february sales meeting as to what you've done so everybody knows
mm
yeah
not least the girls in the office
yeah so it's absolutely clear even if it's a UNK i think it'll be
cos you're right cos we don't want to get people UNK on each other
i think we're actually getting in each other 's way for the right reasons rather than the wrong reasons like just said and it's not a question of somebody else UNK on others er cos i've heard this UNK for some time
people walking in but we need to need to clearly define the areas and if it's that the national account department at has this list of corporate clients then maybe it makes sense that the national account manager responsible for deals with those also
yeah
to avoid repetition
you see we have to be a bit careful because what happens if we closed down right and transferred out to the field
and then we have to change our structure
then we have to change again and that's what you're saying we have to be a UNK
oh yeah we'd have to adapt to the situation we find ourselves with
yeah cos they have they have a tendency to do that sort of thing you see they're changing all the time
we don't know what they'll do so
well i don't see i don't know why we're trying to
no what i'm saying is the UNK the UNK of servicing with a field of national account departments is going to be a potential nightmare
but i don't think that means we have to adjust our sales structure to them it may mean that we have to look at theirs and decide who's gonna deal with what but th but we don't have to gear all our structure
yeah well
no but the national accounts department is set up to deal with the head offices of the key UNK and national accounts
you take and their UNK away from my people we're redundant and you might as well take it all over britain
no that's not quite true
well it is
i mean
for the national account person
well i'm not saying
not necessarily peterborough should be the core
yeah well that's my job peterborough really because that's really just the review every quarter
the core of the business and the business development is at and that's the main problems we've been having with because not co operating
well maybe it's because the person that's been dealing with is not sufficiently UNK with peterborough
UNK got no control over this is this is the problem
well it has but the level that we're UNK at hasn't the level at which
it comes into yeah
well if we were into or into or then it might not be a problem
yeah well
that's where it em that's where it UNK from isn't it
can't think for one minutes if for instance was interested in a deal with that he that er that he wouldn't only just to have flick his fingers and would crap themselves
well they don't really know
well getting into another issue
yeah i know we are but
yeah but i mean that's the way it's meant to work
that's the theoretical version of it
most airlines i'm told by the UNK have one person who look after that camp and they go down from erm regional level to regional sales manager
now you
don't do that but then again they're slightly different i suppose
somebody almost exclusively for
national account manager who's specifically looks after and then go and see on a regular basis but call on them but invariably the accounts that those account managers deal with at erm will be split all round the country and will be controlled by our local sales executives in those areas
yeah i would've thought it was the job of the national account executive or whoever it may be to go there do the business find out what's what and UNK that out to wherever it's most appropriate either to the field sales or to whatever because
it's a peculiar situation
that would avoid a multitude of following people in one after the other
well what we don't want is
what and i used to do
there's people that
used to meet there and go in and see them
yeah crossing over
we used to go see
well why don't well why don't why don't why don't
well you see that complaint is that and myself are not actively seeing these regional managers they believe that we should see them
well if had their way they'd have in all their branches you know i mean you know that's
yeah but i'm looking at how we're gonna this deal through next year because
well that's well that's
perhaps we shall
well you know i agree with ya and i think i think
yes we need to if we're gonna do a deal
if we're gonna do a deal then we have some to drive it through but what i'm saying is that i think that if you have this meeting i which is what february the second
mm
then you argue the UNK amongst yourselves really but you've got you have to
well we are thin on the ground and limited resources so we don't want doubling up that's what we don't want doubling up but i don't i don't
i don't think we should mirror just for the
no but we have to look at what what's a UNK solution
yeah well okay then we'll do it at that meeting and work it out then right
yeah
right then well i think that's the easiest otherwise we gonna waste a lot of time
it must be in your tray cos i've only just got that today
well do you want me to be at that meeting then
well let us explore it first and see what the issues are and then if there's any dispute then you can call another meeting at the february sales meeting we can discuss it
well alright we'll do that way
cos you don't need to get into the UNK
yeah but i'm not erm
i don't want to get into any UNK about anything particularly
we'll see if we can come to a solution
well yes you gotta you gotta see the other person's point of view you gotta understand the structure
i mean for instance is a national account at do any business with us do they
yeah but we wouldn't target that account would we
well you see tha that's one element of it right let me think of another one then er
you can't take your point which we've been trying to tackle at national account level
well is another one
well we've been targeting as well
well that i've already has already done a deal with
i know he has but that's one we're working on
he's done with has he
yeah aberdeen in aberdeen
yeah it's a national account
well you see this is where
basically the criteria is what is the most how is it most sensibly dealt with right cos you don't want a or somebody like that rushing all over the bleeding country going to aberdeen one minute edinburgh the next
no but she's does work with
i mean the one is a classic one when she knew it was scottish based that she passed any correspondence on to
maybe that's maybe that's the that's the system
i just think it's important that say at they have one reference point
well yes
they have one reference point and just that but if it's related to an account then
i only go for tendering of accounts like b t for example
well b t is a national account
well you could argue it is in area because
no it's not because b t all over the country isn't it
one agency point
no it isn't
every single thing's through the one place now for b t the lot
every single b t thing goes to the one location now
wasn't there a case when it was right
that's not the point the point is that er it doesn't matter which agency it goes through it their multi locational site so that's why it's a national account
it's not just in my area they're all over the place in scotland as well so
yeah we need to talk about this because i mean when i saw he was upset by the treatment he got from i presume it was before the way she dealt with him erm and he believed you know he was big enough to be dealt with by the national accounts department
yeah but you know he's an old i mean you know the guy he's quite an old UNK basically he likes to be looked after
but is he gonna give us any business
well he UNK we're losing our business now because we didn't give him a deal
yeah well i know but er he hadn't seen anyone he UNK for well over a year and when phoned me up i agreed to have lunch with him and then he gave me an UNK about all sorts of things including erm in norwich issuing net fares on norwich amsterdam
you know this k l m deal so obviously we hadn't got under the finger until called me in almost UNK
well phoned me about and i passed it to you
yeah but nothing was done so he came through to me
oh well
well he wasn't happy with what he'd received
had basically told him he lived in the stansted catchment area and we didn't need to do a deal with him and that's what UNK him
well on the basis of what was told by the guy she went to see at who was the key account manager
yeah
er no some other UNK who was dealing with the accounts at in UNK
he got a letter on file he produced a load of UNK which were a load of UNK and prove and proved that we weren't losing any business and then he they had a deal with us which was UNK with no restrictions when they were based at UNK
cos they were using right that no the deal hasn't UNK that's what we were trying to do
well according to him it has UNK
we told him it's UNK because they're not at UNK any more and he doesn't like it
so he said oh when he see me he said
the truth will out here
he's told you that you're not we're not getting a fair share of the business with him but the figures i see don't say that at all
well he UNK he hadn't seen anyone from for months
well that's crap
i'm only telling you what he said
well i know but this is but this is where we're caught with our UNK down because we haven't got the thing
when i spoke to about it she said that you told her to hand it over to my department cos it was a national account
well if it is then that's right but it's not
so if she had been told that
well if it isn't yeah if we if and i thought it was national account which means it's a multi locational site which it is
mm
then it's a national account but in terms of the guy not seeing anybody we went to him to sort out what was going on and she must have come away there from with all the sites and said i shouldn't be dealing with this it's a national account it's the national account and that's when i said you must pass it over to then
well can we get this UNK stuff sorted then because this is gonna go on forever because i think to be quite honest it is a lack of communication between two parties
i don't think it is
i think it's in all honesty the UNK have taken decisions
and we haven't got to grips with the corporate market yet fully
yeah well i know that's true erm and we've been power fighting and that's the problem
i think those of you have genuinely erm defined what's been said in two different ways and perfectly correctly because
i think i think we need a meeting to get it laid down we need a meeting to clear the air or not clear the air necessarily but get some definitions some definitions down yeah
mm
cos we can't seem to be cos otherwise we look like flipping UNK
it's not fair on either of you or your people either
well no
all right
well that's the been the problem issue we've been struggling through on that basis
but one thing i would say and i think this is very valid and think pe it won't be long before people start to pick up on it and er we haven't got a national accounts a proper national accounts team cos we haven't got the people and we all know the reasons why but nevertheless you know they're UNK areas of big business with big companies like and not allowed to go into new business
ah hello
no we have put a proposal to but they turned it down twice
yeah i know
cos they said it wasn't good enough
there's quite a few there's quite a few national accounts
yeah come out with look i mean right what happens any travel agent right will tell ya right that these are that there are huge UNK with massive opportunities for business in the corporate sector particularly on because they're used to saying that the reps and in the main will buy that because they'll be able to get something out of it
it's not the same for different set up and they don't understand us therefore they come out with statements like that
no this isn't this isn't travel agents making these statements this is us when we go and talk to say an UNK
well it's the same thing as a travel agent
well i mean you can see from the UNK the figures and routes they fly that we get ten per cent when we should be getting twenty
yeah but you can always establish why though
like remember when we first went to see he UNK we were losing business
when we looked at the figures we proved that we wouldn't get any more business because of where people lived and when we tried to push them to UNK over amsterdam they wouldn't have it people would prefer to drive to gatwick
if there was ever a classic is about the UNK on this side of UNK and he and he wouldn't do anything that supports your business at all
we know we never suggested that said that their business is going down with us and that there was no extra business there for us
erm who was national account manager wanted us to relieve for an UNK
is that tea there
yes
i think basically
but how i structure my department would depend in all honesty on the type of people we get knows this
if we get first division people i'll do it a different way to him if i had to end up with second division people and the responsibilities they take on board will very much reflect that and the same surely should happen to the field sales force erm their abilities are reflected in what sort of activities we give them and by looking at the people we have we then put together a team to most accurately attack whatever we want to do
i'm not sure how i'm going to structure the department it depends on the people i get in all honesty
right okay well can we just leave this for a minute please because we're not getting
i mean it's not a major issue i mean it is an issue it's not a major issue it's just that there have been one or two occasions like where we have cross purposes but considering you know they are a relatively minor tour operator i wouldn't want that to UNK the water because that was just erm a misunderstanding
