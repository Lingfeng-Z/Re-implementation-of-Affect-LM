yes there are far too many UNK institutions that self regulation hasn't worked it ha has no adequate on the UNK we welcomed UNK effective against fraud by replacing it by an independent statutory based regulator which has the power to strike and strike hard rather than everything er by the UNK of regulations we now deal with in the financial er in the financial sector and in the respect of what's proposed today you can't rely er on auditors to be the effective police force that they've been required to be by these er regulations
we don't even have an effective definition of who the auditors er are responsible to
what the government is proposing er is the bare minimum and because it's so minimal you have to ask are they really serious er about dealing with the kind of fraud that er lead er to this attempt to close the er stable door er after the er the horse has UNK
i turn that the point i made about the lack of inquiry because er in effect we know very little about what went wrong with b c i and particularly what went wrong with the audit er of b c i because we haven't had an inquiry er into this country and to what went wrong in that instance
that instance is the justification er for these orders but we don't know er exactly what happened the government hasn't seen fit to institute an inquiry which will tell us
we need the information the last labour government er when they were banking er banking crisis in the early er in the early seventies UNK a series of inquiries there was an inquiry into london and counties there was one into london and capital a series of inquiries which were published the information was there we knew what had gone wrong and we knew therefore how to deal with it
in this instance there's nothing er and er justice bingham er did say specifically that he wasn't pursuing er the matter of er audit it wasn't his responsibility er the government should certainly have repaired that UNK by pursuing it themselves by UNK er into er what went wrong
ministers say well the serious fraud office is looking into it but that hasn't UNK inquiries er in other cases like london united investments and maxwell er so there should be an inquiry er into the audit of b c i so we know exactly what went wrong
i indeed er in the er companies act in nineteen eighty nine the minister himself er argued that for any system to be effective there had to be a distance between regulators and regulations but the only people who have done any inquiry into b c i which is the institute er it itself is the UNK the UNK auditors trying to regulate er the auditors
there isn't that degree of distance which the minister himself asked for er in the committee er on which we both sat er in er nineteen eighty nine
the only inquiry has been the american one and that was handicapped because the british er partners of er price waterhouse didn't pass on to either that inquiry or to the american partners of price waterhouse the information they had about what had gone wrong with b c i so that inquiry itself was inadequate but it is the only one and what that found er was appalling er indeed they were pretty critical about british audit regulation about the auditors performance
it says b c i's accountants failed to protect b c i's innocent UNK er and UNK from the consequences of poor practice
at to page nineteen my lord of the UNK passage that begins my reading of this judgment down to the bottom of that paragraph at letter g so from b to g on page nineteen my lord
yes
now my lord er lord justice er agreed with er lord justice that's at twenty a lord justice also agreed but er added er some further er thoughts on the er on the issue er his conclusion er is summarized of page twenty two paragraph g of the er UNK
yes
now my lord your lordship would of seen from the case and now from the continental television case both in the divisional court and in the court of appeal that where a reference is to be made the court that is marking the reference if what is sort to be done is either to challenge a british statute or in the case of er the red hot dutch case of course with the statute er something which er it involves a UNK decision but in either of those instances the court has got to decide in the interim whether or not the statute or measure should remain in force and there is the priority of public policy as indicated in er lord er speech referred to both in the divisional court and in the court of appeal in continental television in er maintaining the law in force and a bonus has to be faced by the person seeking discipline from the law to show us a sufficiently strong case to justify the er the suspension of the law in the interim
my lord in making my main submissions to your lordship erm i submitted and this is position that there is no distinction between public and private acts in the british rail board both the act and the central fund UNK should be taken as valid in the interim if your lordship is minded to make a reference unless strong evidence of invalidity is so your lordship if you make a reference it needs to form a view as to the strength of the
yes
of the erm of the defendant's case
well how would that how would that fit into the present context erm we're assuming here that i haven't decided the er european points or some of them in your favour
yes my lord
or alternatively because i haven't i have made this clear throughout i come to the conclusion that the questions as posed erm or posed in any court which any one has yet suggested really can't be answered or there are reasons for not answering at this stage whatever it may be
yes my lord
in other words anything except a wholly favourable answer to your clients
yes my lord
in effect yes well then erm just looking ahead in those circumstances erm er on the face of those issues er where do we go from there then
well my lord er you know the society is in your lordships hands in terms of seeking to move matters forward the society is erm very anxious indeed and the reason your lordship knows that the UNK in recovery from central funds should be overcome our primary case er is that er we can demonstrate to your lordship that the european law defences on the preliminary issues should be answered in the UNK favour
well yeah yes
but should you have should you have doubts about that my lord then er what we UNK your lordship to do would be in your judgment er to include a consideration of the strength of the case er your lordship is UNK of the matter now if your lordship er considers that there are issues of law which require clarification from the european court of justice and in competition cases all the european court UNK on references is to give guidance on questions of law your lordship identifies questions of law which need to be i which need to be resolved and you think that it is the most appropriate course to refer a question then we would ask that your lordship consider in the interim the position of the lloyds act clauses there are sort to be challenged by the defences because it will be
yeah well i see all that then what is it literally that you'd ask me to do would you take out an application for judgement on order fourteen would you be expecting me to give judgment or what other courses do you expect be expecting hoping would take
well my lord one approach would be for er your lordship to consider the matter in respect of er order fourteen a er in terms of er the validity in the interim of the er lloyds act and the central fund UNK and that is a matter that your lordship could deal with on the basis of a an oral application
yes erm
in short of having before your lordship a very complicated er UNK of procedural options er the view that has been taken by my lead was the most appropriate er course was to come and argue the issue substantially and then in the light of what your lordship rules thereafter to see the best way forward in terms of further procedural applications to your lordship
er is what you're saying what you're saying apply equally erm UNK rather if i sort information from it i'm not quite sure what sort information i could seek from a commission got any suggestions in that
well my lord you could seek you can certainly seek information from the commission er concerning the state of the proceedings erm that the commission is looking at in respect of the
mm
er complaints that have been submitted you can ask them er erm for factual or legal information in accordance with er paragraphs er thir thirty seven to thirty nine of the guidelines which are in and er page eleven thirty eight to eleven thirty nine
mm could we have the do either of you have the experience of how long how long this might take
my lord it's a relatively new procedure
mm
and erm but the commission i'm sure if your lordship asked for UNK would seek to deal with the matter UNK
yeah
my lord in saying doing it in another case which is an UNK
mm
and the commission UNK this matter for the best part of twelve months already
yeah mm
it's the delay that we are concerned about my lord
well i can understand that yes well i just say wasn't going to rule on this and i'm not in not er convinced at the moment it would be appropriate to rule on it er as part of the er in any judgment i gave but it seemed to me quite important on reflection to hear the way what you were putting it
my lord there are two other grounds
mm
that i would also put it on in relation to your to your lordship and to considering the matter in interim your lordship has er erm er heard er the information that had been put forward er by the society you have seen the er information about the position the commission has taken your lordship knows that the commission was informed about both the act and all the relevant byelaws in the present case the UNK the central fund UNK was informally proved by the commission mrs has UNK on UNK that the society has never been given any indication that the matters in issue in the european law defence are contrary to competition rules and your lordship also has the answer by the commission to the european parliament which is UNK to mrs UNK and which i took your lordship to earlier and of which UNK note can be taken by UNK section three two of the european communities act so my lord we say that there is already a body of information which provides a basis if one has to consider what should be done in the interim of saying that in the interim the application of the act and the application for byelaws should be maintained the third element my lord is the UNK link between the UNK of money for the central fund er under the UNK and the implementation of the united UNK operations under directive seventy three two three nine we've been over this before my lord erm my lord is aware of the UNK link er between the er recovery of monies to central fund the maintenance UNK and the paying of policy holders
if i may my lord there is an issue that was raised in my learned friends reply er which er was a new point er and where i do take issue with him and this concerns the issue of the relevance of the directive here the issue relating to er whether or not the er UNK act and the society have got any relevance in respect of the directive his submission as i understood it was that under article one eight nine the directive only addressed itself to states to the british government and that therefore the UNK on the directive by the society and in relation to the lloyds act was er a UNK er UNK
my lord i'd like to pass up to your lordship a passage from er a leading text book written by doctor derek q c and alan dealing with european community law
mm
and my lord the my lord you'll see at the bottom of page sixty nine this is the latest edition just published this summer my lord erm at the bottom of page sixty nine you have an extract from the european community treaty which er defines a directive and you will see my lord says in terms that it leaves to the national authorities the choice of forms the methods and then if my lord could read the passage er under that on page seventy
yes
my lord the i rely on this passage and your lordship has also got the full section dealing with er the nature of the directive er from er the er from the and book i rely on this as er as indicating both the text of the of the treaty itself and this passage from the learned authors as indicating that it is within the power of the united kingdom
yes
to choose the form and methods by which directive seventy three two three nine should be given effect
yes
and my lord in relation the provisions of the UNK act and the er byelaws that are linked into UNK and the maintenance of er adequate fund and the payment of policy holders in my submission UNK the implementation of that directive and those obligations er in er relation to the society and that is perfectly compatible with community law er it is er the states er have variety of ways in which they can give effect er to community obligations
but you're saying in short are you that erm that in the present instance erm the obligation was put on the united kingdom government which has sort it may have succeeded or not as the case maybe discharge the obligation by in effect erm subject to the subsidiary provisions which you've both make reference and leaving it to er regulate these matters
that's right my lord
yes
one has er and parliament of course did that within
yes i follow i follow that one
mm
does you might i suppose have another point on article five might you not
yes my lord
erm in namely that to the er the duties put upon me
my lord there's a case which i want to bring your lordships attention to in relate in relation to article five and this is the my lord there is a further case that i want to bring to your lordships attention
well tell me what er it's
it's the case
from what proposition are you going to UNK it
erm this is a case which er deals with er the issue of the suspension of a measure based upon community law whether a national court when a measure has been based upon community law has power to UNK it now my lord the er issue in was erm involved er the er decision of er the german government er to give effect to er a community regulation in the sugar sector which er required er that UNK should be er obtained from sugar companies so it was a very direct er implementation of community law erm in that sense different to the matter before your lordship but we rely on it by analogy and in this case my lord er you will see it's in the supplementary bundle of authorities the extra bundle because before your lordship in that case your lordship will see er between paragraphs fifteen and thirty three er the er european court indicating that where a measure that has been based upon a community er law is challenged before a national court that the national court er should er only er engage in the er suspension of such a measure erm if there is serious doubt er this is erm my lord er at er paragraph twenty three of the case er and we say that er if you look at the UNK they are not UNK from those that have been adopted by the house of lords as a matter of english law in the case
mm
we say that it is
it sounds very much the same the same line i mean it'd be very odd if any court came to a conclusion that one put on a UNK grounds erm UNK or ignore any er particular part of european law
well that's right my lord
erm
it's a serious matter
yes but er
and er and we say here that er in respect of directive seventy three two three nine contrary to what my learned friend has said we say the UNK in the v d s case
yeah
that i've already drawn your lordships attention to say that erm the policy holders protection can be given effect to and er that er that er it does not have er the broad construction all UNK construction that eighty five three is the only route that my learned friend has submitted
yeah
we also rely on the fact that the case that i've drawn to your lordships attention yesterday is this was the case in the supplementary bundle where your lordship will recall that er on the issue of export credit guarantee
yes answer your point mr it does er this particular point if you take the directive as i understand
yes
your UNK tell me if i've got it wrong erm it is that er erm are concerned through the chain of command that you've identified let's say the united kingdom in effect will be leaving it to er erm to deal with virtually all er aspects of UNK and protection of policy holders erm the subject to let us specifically prescribed by the er nineteen eighty two insurance act
yes my lord
erm that's one path one could look er down the other part one could look down to one not is article five erm
yes my lord
which is er an obligation imposed on national course among others erm we need to read it to ourselves
mm
and your point in this context it as i say the context in which i've asked you to address me i suppose you would say erm given the matters are UNK or whatever the test is under those issues er nevertheless if you allow the case that's been put up erm either by way of defence or by way of set up or by way of counter claim to UNK the collection of funds erm then er you are not then you are erm taking a measure which could UNK the of the objectives of this treaty er whereas i image you will say or you might say i don't know erm provided this doesn't UNK the collection of central funds erm in the meantime if er the defendants wish to pursue their counterclaim to trial then er there's nothing to prevent them from doing so
my lord our immediate concern is precisely the one you've identified the collection of monies from central
yeah
fund er and we say that er we hope your lordship will be with us on the main issues but if your not we say there are very powerful reasons of english and community law including er the obligation on the court under article five to ensure that the er the trials some two years hence lasting some five weeks with all the expert evidence my learned friend says will be necessary should not in the interim have the effect of er frustrating er the operation of er apparently valid provisions in the united kingdom UNK and the lloyds acts and byelaws which er are themselves measures that have been adopted so as to pursue the policy
well yeah sorry to have to stop you again but i think with great respect one could i think this point shorter i'm only putting it back to make sure
yes
i understand it is that erm even given that this case is UNK erm alright let it be argued out but if er before it is argued out you're not entitled to collect money from a simple fund you are frustrating the objectives of the directive
yes my lord
and that is erm the way i suggest it to you that would be directly contrary to article five
yes my lord
nothing to stop the defendants if they er wish to do so pursuing preparing their counterclaim erm but the one thing it cannot do even if the english law for example set off would otherwise permit it er is to would be to prevent the collection of funds because if the english law was set off and did do that would be running contrary to the directive
mm
and erm something which this court er presumably now doesn't have any jurisdiction to do otherwise it would be breach of article five
er yes my lord there's the prior point that we er we would submit as indicated in the skeleton of the eleventh of november that on its true construction erm the central fund UNK article ten in particular er gives rise to a payment of a specified sum ascertain sum payable UNK on demand it's rather like the example your lordship gave of the UNK or the cheque if my learned friend is right
well maybe that would be to english
that's right
that would be to english law questions which we're certain of interest today
no my lord
er on whether or not erm thi this erm european community defence could amount to a set off er in the face of erm rule ten the central of fund UNK
yes my lord
very interesting question to address
yes
as a matter of pure english law at the moment i have no idea what the answer is
yes my lord
erm what i was putting to you was do you do you say that even if it would as a matter of pure english law it is UNK by community law erm er at least er at least for the time being
yes my lord
because er if it wasn't then there would be a frustration of directive seventy three two three nine
yes my lord
yeah follow that er in so far as it's a counterclaim of course erm but then er unlike a set off with the set off was established as a matter of english law that as far as the counterclaim is concerned the course as i understand the rules is a very large measure of discretion as to whether or not it er it stays the claim on or erm simply say no they'd be a judgment claim immediate enforcement and of the counterclaim go off to trial
yes my lord
yes
my lord i
tie the i was just trying to tie the submission back to the to the situation in which we are presently in
yes my lord
yes
my lord i think it's also helpful to add that in the case erm er your lordship will find at er maybe helpful if you could very briefly look at that judgment my lord
that's erm
this is in the supplementary er the small file
that's your that is your blue bundle
it is my blue bundle my lord
yes
er and
tab
my lord i'm afraid i don't i don't have a tab on my note
what's it for
yes
tab seven four my lord
yes
and my lord er in relation to this judgment er you've got the courts setting out the principal at page er one stroke five forty paragraph fourteen of the judgment that's the principal of suspension and it's then got it's conditions for suspension on the next page paragraph twenty two
i haven't actually got the got page it's rather a long case
it is a long case my lord
where
five forty
five forty
paragraph
erm paragraph fourteen this is the principal of suspension
yes
then UNK my lord you've got the conditions of suspension being indicated by the court justice
yes
and my lord you'll of noticed that in paragraph erm er thirty er they talk about the importance of taking the community interest into account and have proper guarantees and in this instance UNK on page five forty four er they talk about the financial risk to the community this of course was in the agricultural
yes
sector a different sector we're only relying on it by analogy they talk about the position of requiring the applicant by guarantee such as the deposit of money or other security and my lord our submission is very simple er that er the measure that are seeking to recover under are linked into UNK and the payment of policy holders there's a community interest there in the directive but if er for any reason your lordship feels there's a matter that needs to go on and further to a lengthy trial that in the interim what would be compatible with the community object would be to ensure that the monies are recovered into settlement fund er so that the UNK and payment policy holders can continue
yes
but as we stress this is a subsidiary argument that we point
yes those are those are the three grounds then on which you
yes my lord
let's put it accurately erm it would be as presently advised UNK to me in effect events which
yes my lord
possible then
yes my lord
yes well is there any more you want to say on that is er subject to mr as you say of course erm i just simply wanted to know erm so that i can have a look erm at what on one view erm might be the case it might clear be the conclusion that you er incorrect in or partially incorrect or i was unable to answer all the questions er at this stage
yes
yes i think then
my lord i do have some other observations on matters with mr but it maybe more economical and effective on the new issues to wait until after mr has addressed you and to deal with them at one point
i would of thought so mr yes erm alright well mr erm this is a rather odd exercise in a way and as you know my first thoughts were they were better to leave it to see what how the how the judgment came out of it but erm i do regard the matter as er as a as a whole as of very considerable importance both to both sides of this case and erm it did seem to me on considering it er from UNK from the dentist that er an outline of erm
oh yes
what parties might erm be minded to
yes
UNK and submit
yes
er in certain events might be helpful
my lord yes
yes
oh my lord i think there are
i think i'm not i think bound UNK anything you have said this afternoon it's just if you're able to indication or you if you want to keep your powder dry you're perfectly entitled to do so
my lord i'm happy to give an indication and
yes
with the UNK that in the light of your lordship's judgement we may wish to and change erm first of all with regards to the commission your lord your lordships taken to
UNK erm UNK was the case of one which the commissions noticed was UNK erm your lordship of course has the right to seek information to the commission to seek erm information as to the status of the proceedings whether the commission have any market reports which maybe useful and so on
mm
your lordship can't ask for information which maybe confidential to some other party for example what happened to the sugar case
no i can't i can't answer the answer to the questions either can i
my lord i don't think you can
sadly no
i but er but b but fortunately that's your lordships task
er in a way
erm does it
so in a way i mean i'm really almost be in this case be limited to simply saying can you give any idea when you're likely to be able to produce anything other
and they may very well my lord say well we have been watching with great interest what your lordship has been doing
if i
and when
if i was them that's what precisely i'd do too yeah
my lordship may wish to go back to the dentist
mm
erm and they may say
yes
and they have that right to say well it's in the national court we're going to leave it there erm well so i think we would be reluctant to see it go to the commission erm UNK does say in the paragraph after what after fifty three it says well your alternatives is to send it off to UNK
mm
and that maybe something your lordship may wish to consider i'm a little bit UNK as to why my learned friend has gone for cases on interim measures we're not seeking interim relief we haven't sorted interim UNK erm to UNK the validity of any particular measure that was the basis of all of his case
well that maybe true but i think it's working off an analogy on that turning it the other way round and saying well erm if i got to the stage of erm well possibly even seeking some information from the commission well certainly if i gave you a conclusion for example that it should be referred erm and i think again even if i came to the conclusion that i should neither want er there's no point in seeking information from the commission nor should i refer it or at least refer to the stage erm what his clients would be saying should be done in the interim and what he says in effect for the reason he's outlined is er that we should proceed on the basis of erm the validity of the act erm and of the byelaws
mm but my lord that can i take that
and then following through the suggestion i've put to him erm on one scenario at least to it could even you erm perfectly erm able to pursue your counterclaim
mm
but not to use it by way of UNK off calls for central fund money
mm
that again is the same expression as that is mr bottom line
mm
er he wants money coming in to the central fund er if has in two years time to face a trial these allegations so be it but meanwhile he wants the money to come in to the central fund for the reason he's outlined
well let me take that stage by stage
mm
first of all if there's a reference no question of validity arises what would happen is proceedings are stayed subject to turns that your lordship may direct or order and then
is that is that
that's what happens
well is it is what happens is it what's bound to happen
no my lord no my lord that is what UNK happens i mean my lordship
well is it the case or i mean or obviously i stayed it erm
well there was nothing left which wouldn't
there was no point in doing anything else no
no my lord that's right but that doesn't mean to say that if your lordship didn't stayed there would be any if your lordship did or didn't stayed or any part of it doesn't UNK a validity of section fourteen until one's got a judgment saying it's bad for example i mean that's what we're arguing about until such and the
well that's right you're quite right mr that's why i then i then put mr points in the context of where we've got to
mm
because er if he if he didn't get a clean win on these
my lord
points if he didn't i think
that's only the time a problem arises
yes
erm that the question then arises are you are you er able put the matter up as a as a defence as a set off or as a counterclaim with a stay of execution on the claim
my lord erm first of all if your lordship stayed the counterclaim your lordship would be staying the claim under article eighty five and your lordship would be denying the direct effect of article eighty five and of course
no stay no stay of the counterclaim
well my lord yes the stay of the counterclaim as a set off that would then be denying article eighty five as a shield well of course it wouldn't undermine the defences based upon article eighty five per se the other ways i mean the set off is simply one way in which the defence arises it arises in three other ways as your lordship seems to have an opinion security or set off is simply one of the ways the defence but it's not the only defence so to simply state that part of the defence would not get the would not mean that the article eighty five defence erm er UNK in any way shape or form the whole defence would have to be stayed so that there was none no defence left a defence on article eighty five
there are incidentally i think bits of even there is a duty of care isn't there which there's duties floating around in your defence somewhere
er yes and co yes my lord there is of course a great deal more in respective
although i suspect there's what you're gonna stand on
they er they may well my lord
mm which have to be er i'd heard it's round about january sometime is that right
february the twenty eighth
is it
february the twenty eighth end of february yeah my lord so of course erm staying the counterclaim as a set off wouldn't really progress much further because after eighty five i mean that's simply a subsidiary way in which the defence arises article eighty five arises primarily because we say underlying the arrangements are void and you're UNK something which is void and you can't do it that's not a set off claim but your lordship i mean my lord that's why that doesn't really get them any further my lord they've always had outstanding which they've never pursued er for order fourteen so they can always ti try as they said they will for the other erm UNK attacks upon us
mm
erm strike out interim payment order fourteen er itself there's always still available to them erm that the other side of the coin is if they get their money and of course they're going to be threatening UNK for some four thousand odd names i mean that's equally UNK to individuals erm my lord one would be into a type of argument on balance of convenience if we were at this stage one would be considering the UNK of the names whether they have the funds to pay even if judgment is given against them because vast majority don't and what would be the point of giving judgment this order fourteen cases saying one shouldn't do it in those circumstances what if the names are right will they get the money back will they get a cross undertaking damages and pre er and to what extent do now have the funds to what extent will it actually effect their business in the light of
mm
the state of the premium trust funds these are the sorts of consideration one would need to take into account er a no doubt they would they'd need to be argued fully at a at a later stage but the only question here is if your lordship refers and there's going to be some delay well erm i was trying to think of an UNK case er and the case which went to the european court at the beginning of last year had consequences which were potentially far more profound than this case is it was the case concerned the application of equal pay principles to pensions
mm
and er if it was applied UNK the er estimates which were put for the european court
yes
was that it would er have implications in the united kingdom UNK to some sixty billion and the UNK general came to UNK to tell the court about the dire consequences er your lordship raised consequences in the context of an arguments under article five
yes
erm my lord in relation to that erm and er is an example the european court itself and only the european court has the power to limit the direct effect of the provision they can say well it has direct effect in these circumstances UNK but not UNK and only the european court that court alone has that power all other courts national courts must my lord this is your duty under article five i would submit to enforce article eighty five and three f
yeah er well i follow that but the argument would go er the article
my lord
that nobody was nobody was in the business of not UNK those erm but the only way i could erm fulfil the obligations arising out of the treaty and UNK from measures that UNK the UNK of the objectives of the treaty er was to allow the monies to be collected by er leaving you free to pursue your counterclaim because then if you're right erm then you would achieve everything you are entitled to achieve by your counterclaim that would achieve the objectives of article eighty five erm whereas the collection of the money would achieve the objectives of the directive
my lord
that was the suggestion i put to er mr erm
my lord my lord two answers
then adopted you're wrong they UNK adopted them as my lord erm first of all article eighty five is direct my lordship has heard all about that to do that would be UNK difficult the enforcement of the directly effective provision and your lordship has no jurisdiction to do that
erm
because we would not be able to raise it as a shield in that one respect now if your lordship tried and then said well alright we stay the counterclaim is a set off then what would your lordship be intending to do about the remaining defences to say we're not allowed defend our claim er at all on the basis of article eighty five will that be
that you say remaining UNK what remaining defences
well the er i mean my lord if your lordship
i mean if you've got other non and we're assuming
set aside
we're assuming for the purposes of the argument that you haven't i mean it's gotta be you've got other defences altogether er and indeed terms of which i haven't made my mind up yet but with judgement and your duty of care erm may themselves solve this particular problem
er my lord yes
i quite agree but if they if those exists well then there's a erm well i suppose again mr might actually then adopt even further my article five suggestion
say that you're not allowed to run those because they'd be contrary to the directive but er we'd have to wait and see
that would be to completely undermine the effect of article eighty five we simply wouldn't be able to raise our shield at all we would have a counterclaim but at which point since we had no of what erm for example as one of it's principal defences erm we would say we've made the plaintiffs case very much easier they've now got all our money we're bankrupt we can't pursue our claim because we've got no money to pursue it with in article eighty five would of been completely undermined because we would not of had a realistic opportunity to raise article eighty five as a defence and your lordship to do that would of had to not only set aside the counterclaim as a set off but also to set aside the entire eighty five defence to stayed it or to have set it aside
but of course we're assuming for the purposes of the argument that er that erm your that is a matter of UNK english law the matters of which you make complaint are a defence or set off
my lord we there is
er but if there're not
my lord we've assumed as a matter of english law that i think the counterclaim can arise as a set off but the other matters are a matter of community law
mm
not english law
yes
my lord er in my submission the highest really could put their case is that if the matter were referred your lordship simply didn't stay proceedings or permitted them for example to apply for interim payment or permitted them to take some procedural steps to pursue their action so that they weren't unduly delayed should they succeed at the end of the day and that would be a major UNK because it would run against a normal rule cos on a reference the entire proceedings are stayed that's not a case just saying even if that is done er that anybody is saying that particular measure is or is good is not good or may not be forced in the interim
mm
because validity of the section fourteen is the question for ultimate trial we're not seeking interim relief against that we haven't done that my lord that in our submission is the highest and the best that they could achieve erm properly erm which was to avoid a stay on a reference and they could then continue with the proceedings rather than be put off for a very you know what maybe a year and a half er if the court dealt with it in the normal way or perhaps even a little bit longer erm but to actually go to further than that and to deny the defendant the right to put up a proper e c defence my lord in my submission would be erm without the jurisdiction of the court
yes
my lord erm just to sweep up one or two of the other very briefly the points my learned friend has just raised erm i think it follows that our provisional position at the moment is that we think that reference is probably more satisfactory than simply going to the commission what went if your lordship went to the commission and then found that they were unsatisfactory or didn't really take matters further for one of the reasons it might very well not is because the original complaint put to the commission was not UNK in the same way as the defence and counterclaim are now UNK er there's been a very considerable amount of UNK both parties would no doubt wish to put submissions into the commission as to how the answer should be put or to provide information so the commission can answer them and so on and so forth and it may not be any quicker doing it that way
mm
than going to the court erm for
the only attraction of that is would be if you could both be able to tell me that if i erm wrote them a letter or you wrote them a letter on my behalf erm and they say of yes they are going to deal with this erm next friday or something
it would be quite good idea to wait till next friday but the chances of that seem to be totally remote
my lord i would think that
now
probably not even that high
apart from anything else er your complaint has been rather UNK by events and both parties would no doubt wish to or may well wish to take further er but i think you'll both agree that prospects of er let say getting any meaningful answer out of the commission by christmas are remote
well my lord the position as er your lordship is aware from the letter UNK to mrs UNK is the commission were informed in neutral terms
mm
about this hearing
yes
they've had a copy of the order we have heard no reply from them so
no
my lord very briefly just sweeping up one or two points my lord i don't think i need to because as i say we're not challenging the law erm i don't think that's the right context in which these problem arise
yes
er my lord simply directives under one art article one eight nine erm i can very simply say in relation to the lloyds act and to the bye laws they were adopted ten years after the directive there can't therefore be an implementation they the implementation is fully set out in the insurance companies act nineteen eighty two and it quite clear now because the secretary of s
well i'm not sure i'm not sure they can't implementation i mean we're supposed to erm implement erm equal pension rights for men and women
mm
we're not actually going to finish doing that until twenty which will be er nearly forty years on really
look may i put it this way we're in the directive of being able to point to something which UNK the secretary of state to delegate the function that what's it for
well i do think i have i have those points erm i don't want to stop you mr er and i do repeat i'm going to i'm going to rule on these matters and both parties have er erm will have certainly have full liberty to come back and deal with them i just wanted to know in outline the present parties er to the future of these proceedings
er the one thing that has come clear through er your submission mr is that you're not er in any way UNK of the idea that there should be some scheme whereby your clients erm pay their central fund and demands and er and erm maintain their counterclaim here after
my lord indeed i hope that has come across very clearly
yes well i'd be rather surprised if you UNK to the idea erm yeah can mr help us on that this position
my lord i can i'm sitting early tomorrow because a witness is being cross examined by mr got to go off to so tomorrow he simply could not er he si simply could not be released but er with your clerk er we've been able to speak to mr
mm
we've been slightly more UNK but invite to your club UNK to ask your lordship rather me but as i'm on my feet er ask your lordship whether you could sit at all early on friday as to help mr er i was little concerned to hear mr say that he was going to wait for mr he had responded because that would of course then extend more into friday it may be more sensible if mr could have
well you would if i think it's unsatisfactory er to get to ask mr to deal with mr
yes my lord
and then mr i think necessarily may be saying something the same as or along the same lines as mr and then mr have er yet another go i think it that's in which case i'm not very satisfactory because er it means that mr has got to UNK his final remarks erm twice
my lord in which case i think ev even with mr putting in his notice will it's bound to take an hour
yes
erm may i suggest mr if your lordship would care to sit at ten o'clock and then think he'll get at eleven fifteen but really in
erm
under very great stress he's already lost one judge because this
well i think erm the short answer is that i can't erm provide the parties with any time on friday er the case this case has already some what over run it's estimate which has put pressure on the commercial judge as it is there's gonna be even more pressure on friday erm i'm afraid to say the that the UNK of this case as such that i cannot erm begin to think that even if we started at ten we would erm necessarily finish within the hour i have difficulties starting at ten o'clock anyway i think we'll simply have to erm put the matter off until monday morning i mr can't attend i really don't think that i can erm put it off er any longer than that
er my lord he'll obviously have to make enquiries as to whether he can ask his next case to start
mm erm because i've got to provide some answer before christmas even if it even if the answer is that i can't provide an answer
yes
erm er and i'm have to take some time over this so i think erm in the circumstances the better thing to do would be to adjourn this case till monday morning and hope that mr can so arrange his affairs to address me at half past ten on that day er with mr and with erm whatever rights he has to erm deal with matters of this come up a fresh in reply and to finish off i'm gonna leave it like that a very much and as i say as far as far as UNK concerned that's er not a difficulty with erm either mr UNK me which is unlikely or i can at least get a make a start er on the other aspects of the judgement alright then half past ten on monday morning
court rise
yes
enough of the UNK chat please 's here and no
yes
oh he is there
yes
's er
yes miss
no and claire
what about me
what about you
right now we turn we're on page twenty nine
UNK
excuse me hello
can you get your notes out on page twenty nine we're halfway through o k right
page twenty nine
well you've read up until where margaret comes in on page thirty haven't we where does she come in
well she comes in on page thirty two rather
er and we're discussing erm page twenty nine yeah
have you all got notes so far on george
you should have the notes on what george represents
america
yeah so i'll run through that and make sure you've got all those points down then we'll start to think about nick o k
no sorry you've got notes on nick on nick
and george
and george so i'll run
through them and you make sure you've got them all down o k
right so nick first he represents biology and the future and you've probably got all these things
if you've got them just check them that they're there alright
he represents biology which represents the future as far as george is concerned he represents genetic engineering and a very frightening kind of vision
george
of the future
this is what george thinks of nick
oh
you see
you have to be careful you can't actually say that nick represents this or that you have to say that george thinks that he represents and sort of a kind of genetic engineering which would turn out a generation of perfect people alright
this is erm nick and i said that erm it's rather confusing here because on the one hand he represents the american dream boy because he's young he's beautiful he's got his future ahead of him
he's got as you know a shining career ahead of him
erm but on the other hand and so it's valid to say he represents the american dream yeah
physically in terms of his character and where he's going
on the other hand the ideas that are associated with him such as this fascist idea of engineering a super race o k are UNK you know sort of UNK ideas aren't they and if you think about the political erm context in which this play was written
o k the cold war you've got russia and america building up their arms and so on and fighting all these kind of erm secret battles
erm then nick actually represents nicholas UNK which i think is spelt on here
it was on here now it's gone
UNK
UNK
UNK
who was president of russia
spelt like that
o k
so and the reason
and the reason
shh
the reasons critics have said erm that this may be the case is because the equation works erm very neatly
if you can think about george and UNK name what is the significance one person of george and UNK name
george
one person anne
george washington
right o k so george washington was the first president of america and his wife actually was called UNK
so there is a very kind of neat equation there
unfortunately honey doesn't s fit into it
i don't know if honey even existed in russia and i somehow doubt it
so erm but that has w has led some critics to suggest that the whole play in fact is about the cold war
it's a very political play o k so now we're moving on to george
did he ever did like say that's what he meant by
no this is purely speculative
so nobody's ever asked him
no and i don't think he would answer you even if he did
even if you asked him
you know critics er UNK don't like to be pinned down
you say you know this play is about this
the thing is that i am sure he was aware of associations but that doesn't mean to say that it is a political play er and that was the only purpose of his writing that
i am sure he has other purposes as well it's basically about a marriage breaking down
but it doesn't that doesn't mean to say that these associations you know aren't there and that we shouldn't would be wrong to point them out
i think we are quite justified in pointing it out
do we have to conclude from if it was a play about the cold war what is the conclusion of it
i mean
well
is it russia trying to prove by
erm
it is political
i don't think he really comes to a conclusion
i think he's just UNK the situation as it was kind of UNK of each other playing games with each other you know that kind of fits it doesn't it
erm UNK and you know UNK people and pretending if you haven't got any nuclear UNK when you have and that kind of thing you know you will hear playing games like that aren't they hiding up the truth
it's not a good enough reason to like
no it isn't
characters into your
it's not sort of like a
go on
it's not like a good enough reason for him to call the characters these names like if they don't have that much significance
why didn't he call them something else
exactly
so you're saying that because they have these names their probably is an equation
that
yeah they're probably there should be more of one than there is
oh right so it's not s it's not enough for you to be convinced
yeah
well i think you know it's not essentially a political play
emma can you concentrate but on the other hand i think that we would be missing something if we didn't point out that it has that side to it alright
so i am just throwing it out in the air i don't think it's that s
it doesn't work as a political play
no it's not it's not it's main erm way of communicating
on the other hand it does fit in
let me just finish
about george
let me explain about george and i think you'll understand better
george o k i've said that he represents america in the cold war merely because of his name but there's actually more to it than that because he erm he believes in history and in the past and his values are very old fashioned
this comes out in this page we'll have a look at it in more detail in a minute
so he re he represents sort of old fashioned moral values and he UNK the kind of UNK which he thinks he can see in nick
that paradox isn't it if nick has fascist quality
mm
qualities
yes
but he represents russia
exactly no yeah he represents the american dream
no well russia by his name
if w if we are taking as a political thing
nick as russia
mm
and then he's pointed as this fascist who
oh you are saying
so you are pointing out that russia wasn't fascist
what are you saying
well yes because i mean if n erm george is supposed to represent america
yeah
then nick is supposed to represent russia UNK
mm
how come he has all these fascist qualities in him
who nick
yes shouldn't he be communist
yes
it's like completely UNK
it doesn't work
well what i want
doesn't work does it
he can't be one and the other
no he can be an american dream and he can also represent russia because they're different things that you're talking about
you know the american dream is to do with ideals
whereas russia is erm is to do with the cold war situation but i take UNK point that UNK and communism are not the same thing and to say that he has fascist ideas does not necessarily mean that he therefore represents russia in this political equation
but i don't think it's really worth worrying too much about whether he's fascist or communist because erm the only reason really there's only link between him and russia and the play is a is the opposite of america in other words george and b because his name UNK which links it to the leader of the er
because he's young and UNK and he's new
mm
versus the old it can be looked as communism because it's a new thing it's being
thank you
by the way he's with fascist ideas that all this
i mean some of the fascist ideas surely hitler who had fascist ideas
mm
and i mean what's the link between hitler and communism
nothing
he didn't like
not really he didn't like
mm
there is nought
put that in your dictionary
o k
alright well let
i take your point
so in that case all we can say is that the link was between nick
and russia is to do with his name yeah
and that's all
well the other thing to do with being fascist
the other thing is to do with being fascist yes but you know you erm you can talk about russia you know running under the UNK and all the rest of it before communism came along
that would have been a fascist kind of imperial erm state wouldn't it
is it more that just like a general representation of UNK and communism
yes
like revolution
exactly yes and the young threatening the old which michael just UNK pointed out amongst his more er
genetic engineering as well
yes exactly
created everybody the same
well you see exactly which is why i mean we're getting into problems here because we're trying to say that one character equals one thing and it's not that it's you know nick he's a scientist he's a UNK he also represents in a way russia he also represents you know kind of erm the new of the young threatening the old
but then in that case
then george represents the old value of systems
then it's very hard for the audience or people reading the play to pick anything up from it because it's all mixed up and it's just an UNK of
one at a time one at a time please
it's for each person that's why like the UNK doesn't specify what each thing's supposed to mean because it can mean whatever it wants to each member of the audience
exactly
then it UNK them personally
and if you were a lecturer in politics and you went to see this play then you might think oh look oh and then you'd start thinking and if you were a scientist you would think about it in another way and if you were an artist you'd think about it in another way
but if he was trying to be a political UNK then shouldn't he clarify what he
well what i am saying is that i don't think it is his primary concern
right it is not the main line of the play
the play is basically a psychological study of a UNK break up yeah of a couple and the other couple are very largely just an audience to george and UNK marriage yeah that is the main line
though what i am trying to do is just explore all these possible lines of thoughts erm in a political way alright but they don't work out neatly and these critics got quite excited about so i thought i ought to point them out to you but you're quite right in pointing out that they don't work out neatly o k so we've got to where have we got to with george
erm right
he represents the past and he keeps talking about history because he is history and i said that he 's he represents old fashioned moral values
let's have a look at the text now cos it will hopefully make these a lot clearer and you will see what i am on about
right erm so page twenty nine you can look at the top you can see george says you're the one you're the one that's going to make all that trouble
so how does he feel about nick
one person
he feels threatened
he feels threatened by him fine
alright you're the one that all that trouble
because nick is ju erm is young and because he associates him with all these dangerous ideas in genetic engineering and so on he feels threatened by him
so to that extent george is on the side of history isn't he
he's saying i don't like what's happening now
erm if you look at the next speech he makes he says do you believe that people learn nothing from history
so in other words he's saying you should look to history to try and understand what's happening
he suggests that there is something to learn from history
alright so he looks to the past for his moral UNK and he UNK that nick is looking to the future
so we're on page thirty now
twenty nine about a third of the way down
alright so all these points are quite easy and straightforward aren't they
george looks back to the past and nick looks forward to the future
erm then we get to a rather inter funny bit really
in the middle of page twenty eight george lists all his different erm qualifications that he says he has and i am not quite sure what an is an m a master of arts p h d which is a doctor of erm philosophy and he puts them all together to make up this word UNK which doesn't exist obviously as a real word
he's just made it up and he says it's been described this word as a wasting disease of the UNK and where are your UNK
in your brain
yes so what's he saying
slight he's got on his qualifications
his UNK wasted away
exactly
so it's a joke o k it's sort of er at himself a self critical joke
saying fine i've got all these erm degrees and there's a wonder drug in other words can do wonderful things
in me all these things
so what's he saying
he's kind of UNK nick and saying i've got all these degrees
then he makes up this funny word and says it's the name of a disease by which his brain is UNK away
so it's a kind of joke about UNK who are totally incapable of any original thought
o k and really very UNK biology
so again you see that he feels threatened and er doesn't trust nick because of erm these ideas which he associates with nick
he assumes that nick is you people are UNK my genes so that everyone will be like everyone else
which is actually a very s serious idea and he is opposed to that new kind of genetic engineering alright
so to that extent he represents sort of old fashioned moral values you know this sort of thing shouldn't be allowed to happen it's disgraceful
so saying they're very old fashioned erm sort of democratic ideas aren't they
and the idea of making everyone look like each other is a communist idea yes
sort of everyone should be the same everyone should have equal rights and equal erm opportunities
so that what nick he UNK nick is doing whereas he UNK that
so now can you see how politically there is a kind of political UNK to this section erm as i say you can only follow it so far down a road then you come to a dead end but i think it's there and you can't really ignore it the political UNK
all got that as a phrase the political UNK
and it UNK up at various different stages through the play as well it's not just erm you know
i just can't buy it i'm sorry but if the author is going to put elements a political element into it he must be steering the audience towards something because why bother putting all these points up because everybody UNK what the cold war is
i mean he's not really pointing anything out that nobody already has known
i think the only difference is how far beneath the surface the UNK is
i mean you can interpret any play you want to twelfth night for example is having a political UNK if you look far enough beneath the surface of the play
the question is how near to the surface of the play is it and how that is what influences wh the audience as to how important they think it is
if someone stands at the front of the play at the front of the stage and says you know i believe in democracy then you know you are let into a political play yeah
here you become just UNK aware but you start thinking mm you know george is old fashioned he doesn't like what's happening around him he's rather conservative in that way
oh look his name's the same as the first person of america
oh and his wife's got the first name too and the name of the his wife too and then you begin to you begin to put a few equations together
i don't think you know he's not trying to UNK it down our UNK but it is there michael
yes and if erm it was all like a political bit all the way through it they wouldn't be like re real characters
exactly
and you wouldn't get all this psychology bit in as well
exactly
it's more psychological isn't it then
more psychological definitely yes
yes absolutely
alright
o k so carry on then
as tim said you have to hold on to the fact that these are real characters and their in a kind of UNK situation here aren't they
and each feels er sort of under threat from the other
erm and it's very largely because of the ideas that are associated with them
erm where did i get to oh yes
well he's talking about the er genetic engineering he says that it will be a shame
then he makes a joke out of it and says you know if everyone was forty something and looks fifty five
so in other words he makes a joke about his if they all looked like me wouldn't that be awful
so he's kind of making a joke about it but there is a serious point there as well
that he feels kind of disappointed and upset by what he sees happening in science around him
disappointing he says disappointing alright
then at the bottom of the page erm he says i am in the history department and he says i shall probably tell you several more times and indeed he does in the play
UNK tells him often that i am in the history department as opposed to being the history department in the sense of running a history department
i do not run the history department
erm why is he telling all nick this do you think
all this to nick
i mean how does it come over
what's it doing to their relationship
is he erm bring himself down a bit to UNK level cos nick and hasn't really got any position
he's
possibly
is he just opening up a bad
open
trying to be like on a more friendly basis with nick
yes
how his marriage works
that's right yeah
he's kind of UNK his UNK and failures isn't he
his sense of failure
if you do that to someone then you open yourself up don't you
i thought he was UNK saying to that by the time she got round to saying it wouldn't mean as much
quite possibly that as well anne
i agree
yes it's to kind of UNK before she has a chance to get in there
well why would he want to tell him all his failures especially that he's viewing nick as an UNK
that's right it's just changes tack now doesn't it really
stop being UNK it's more to do with erm you know i think he actually wants sympathy from him
to open yourself up to someone like that i am a failure then you're kind of establishing a different level of relationship aren't you
does he get any kind of sympathy i mean how does nick respond
well i don't know i'm the biology department what's he trying to do there
make him feel better
make him feel better comfort him exactly
alright so we're back into the UNK now aren't we
it's not what they say it's what lies underneath the words it's interesting
alright and then there's this extraordinary bit erm that george has in the middle of page thirty about what happened when he did run the history department for four years during the war
what's interesting about that little UNK speech there
people who haven't said anything this lesson from i did run the history department that main speech there
what's interesting about that speech
what does he appear to UNK
what's surprising about it
come on what's surprising about that
about what
about that speech there
i did run the history department it's quite UNK isn't it
it's quite shocking as well
are you looking at the right bit
erm i don't think you are you don't know where we are page thirty half way down
wrong page right o k come on help her out somebody else
isn't it that he only had the job because nobody else was there
mm
so it's sort of quite sad really
it is actually it makes him feel rather sad erm and also rather funny and therefore he rather comes over a rather pathetic UNK
get that in before erm and er come on what else there's something shocking about that speech what's shocking about it
upset got killed
you know he's like upset that nobody got killed
he's not upset
he's ups he's not upset he's not bothered
exactly
he wishes like somebody did get killed
he wishes that they'd all got killed
because that would mean that he would have been able to hold on to his job
so he's a really
he doesn't really he's does he
i thought it was just like UNK that it hadn't
yeah but it's just a joke
what i am saying is a joke you know it's not in very good taste is it
i mean this was written in nineteen was it sixty four perhaps
two
sixty two only you know not that long after the war had ended and to the UNK that nobody got killed you know you might have had more chances e of success if they had all got killed
i think it's pretty shocking it's actually in that kind of stage
and then what about what's interesting about the way that speech ends
extraordinary
go on one of you
how does the speech end
by changing the subject
mm
completely
to
mm
what about her
her small hips
about her small hips why hips
why not legs or UNK or
because of the way UNK introduced her to him
when she first said that there were guests coming round she said UNK she didn't have any hips
oh yes that's true
yes and that's what
george has remembered
exactly it's about UNK isn't it i mean having hips is also to do with your shape sexually isn't it
i mean it's going in and out at the right places but it's also to do with UNK o k so george is changing the subject there completely kind of off the wall isn't he er this comment
and so what does this reveal about him then
why did he suddenly do that
it it's confusing him
he is talking about something and suddenly changes the subject
yeah but why
to stop UNK himself
to stop
UNK himself
possibly yes he kind of like wants to erm move off but then he comes back to it in a minute though so that doesn't quite hold
what is i mean why is he
business
why is he interested in th this business of well erm nick and honey
or whether nick erm honey has hips
is it sort of child bearing
why is
if she had any kids
she can have kids
she can have kids that's right and it's also well it's back to his own his own fantasy child isn't it and th his own UNK to have children with UNK
so this kind of erm interest in children and in whether a couple are able to have children or not is has obviously been lying at the back of his mind hasn't he
i mean this could be another area in which he feels threatened because he thinks if nick and honey have children then that again will reinforce a sense of failure won't it
he needs to find out
alright
and in fact it is as if we're having it is if george is actually having two conversations at the same time
UNK he's talking about his career and history department and he goes back to it again
not one son of a UNK got killed
of course nobody no that's not fair and then all the time he keeps coming back to this issue
you have any kids
alright
and when nick asks him how does he respond
right at the bottom of the page thirty
come on easy question
that's for me to know and you to find out
yes
a kind of a challenge
alright
so he's also UNK
so what's interesting here is that they seem to be having a conversation about un the university matters the history department and so on but in fact there's this kind of UNK going on here in which both of them want to find out about the other person's children and both of them are being very UNK and avoiding the question
no kids ha
not yet
no that's another strange thing
erm i think that was gay and
i'll have to look it up
he was also adopted
yes exactly which is what is interesting for the american dream isn't it
mm
a lot of things like that which happen to him he then put into his drama
he was adopted himself
i think he was gay
i don't think he ever got married
and so this interest in marriage and this kind of UNK and you kn i think it would be very natural i think for a gay person to feel terribly UNK of people who can create a family and er and this kind of UNK with babies
anyway then we get to another funny bit on page thirty one
erm people do erm have kids and then kids links them with the what they were talking about before the genetic engineering because now what they start talking about two things kind of come together the two themes and then they start talking about
test tube babies
test tube babies exactly yes
then there's a wonderful line
then the rest of us them as wants to can screw to their heart's content
a what does he mean when he says that and b what's the effect of all that on the audience
that bit about screw to their heart's content
wonder wonderful bit of language
UNK not just about having babies
sorry
that UNK not just about having babies
er yes
o k yes
that it's fun yes
to their heart's content
in other words sex can be great fun you don't need to have to do it in order to just have babies
if you make babies in test tubes then er you know the rest of us don't need to worry about it
in fact it would be just one less thing to worry about if we could all er screw to our heart's content
o k yes well it says what it means
what effect is it going to have on the audience
shocking and
shocking and
you were all laughing yes that's amusing as well
it's also the big a word absurd
because it's so unlikely and it's so shocking and it's such a funny thing to say
well then yes the next bit actually is more absurd than that sorry
what will happen to the tax deduction
now i assume that in america as in england if you have children you then get some financial help
in this country you get a you know child benefit that you and in america you would obviously get a tax deduction if you have children
so he's saying it's a kind of complete kind of UNK thinking
you know if everyone around and they didn't actually have their own children
they just had their children developed in UNK in test tubes
ha how would you be able to claim for your tax deduction
so it's a wild bit of sort of er UNK thinking there
very amusing
i am sure that an america would love that but it may not you know to an english audience because er we might not be sure what they are talking about
so again they talk around subjects
nick UNK to say whether he's got any children or not and george keeps saying you know
are you going to have children
are you going to have children
and nick keeps saying
well yes we want to wait we want to wait
can you now look in the middle of page thirty one
this is erm and this taking in not only the room they had the whole countryside
this is your heart's content UNK penguin island UNK
do you think you're going to be happy here in new UNK jane
let's have a look at all those places he refer to and then work out why he's referring UNK
so UNK we should all know what UNK is
describe the land of UNK to me
UNK
well
what it's basically like
erm
wasn't it erm a country with a cost
yes alright yes
that's a very literal one
what's the atmosphere like in UNK
which play we're talking about by the way
twelfth night
right what's the mood then what's the atmosphere
UNK
UNK come on keep going lots of things
what's the mood of it twelfth night
love
light
love light full of light
dream like
dream like definitely
confused
confused definitely
mad
mad definitely yes
all those things yeah
do you see the links now
in what way dream like
dreams and people UNK each other
in this play they have UNK children UNK yes
so that link there between dreams and UNK and being UNK and going mad i think is quite clear isn't it world and between UNK world
penguin island i was UNK informed the other day is the island where erm UNK
joking
penguin comes from
you're joking
no i'm sure you're probably right and it
who is the penguin anne
come on
is he good or bad
he's a UNK
right he's a UNK thank you
so that's an evil place yeah
a strange and evil kind of fantasy world yeah
UNK
yes what happened to UNK and UNK
they got destroyed punished
yes because
the they
yes good
so what did god say
to UNK them from their UNK
mm
take them away from it
no he just destroyed everything he just
but why i mean because yes because they were UNK and evil
he actually said to them if you can find you know a hundred good men then i won't burn your city and then he put it down and down and down and had a good old bargain
if you can find ten men
if you can't find ten men
if you can find one good man then i won't burn down your city and they can't get anybody so UNK the whole lot goes up o k so UNK
UNK is one of the cities in the bible UNK is the other one UNK and UNK were destroyed by god because people there were so evil
it's the city of
it's the name of the city is it
no
right
because
and the last one
do you think you're going to be happy here in new UNK aye
it's classical
yes from classical UNK greek classical UNK
what happened to it
died
the romans UNK it
they UNK it yes
they burnt it down didn't they and from the this is from UNK
because UNK
that was revenge was it
it's not in the UNK is it
yeah
i am UNK informed
no it's referred to and UNK but it's not actually what happened to the city
well that i think the original one is from
it just another reference
it's another reference yes at a revenge again
so somewhere that was UNK and destroyed out of revenge
so what do all these things
i mean what is george on about here
they're all classical
i mean they're all history
yes historical references sure and UNK references as well because he represents the arts amongst other things whereas nick represents the sciences
is he just saying that the place he's living in is a dump
exactly then there and what's this question to nick then
oh why do you want to stay here why don't you leave
exactly and more to the point
why do you want to
what's the UNK of this whole section here
what do they keep on going back to
having children
kids
having children
why do you want to have children in somewhere that is mad evil and about to be destroyed
there's a sort of sense that all those places are kind of UNK places aren't they
before they get destroyed
so nick is a little defensive
i hope we'll stay here
that is he's answering in a sense george's question
why do you want to stay here
o k erm right we'll just finish it to up to where UNK comes in
erm at the bottom of the page then george starts talking about UNK father and it gets very funny this bit very naughty
erm look flip your eyes down the bottom of the speech on page thirty one what is erm amusing which bits are amusing and describe the humour in that speech there by george
page thirty one or two
one at the bottom
come on and we'll finish in time
how do you describe the humour there
running around absolutely in UNK
UNK
no
weird humour sort of
weird humour right
cynical
cynical
absurd
absurd yes so which bit would you say is absurd
the bit about everyone in the in a dinner queue
in a dinner queue yes someone UNK and dying in the dinner queue is rather absurd and it's also very
it's not happy is it
what kind of humour is it
black humour
black yes exactly
the best bit i think is when he says that the erm we make excellent UNK right at the bottom there
o k over the page
he then starts talking about UNK father who was not going to die apparently
UNK father has the same of those UNK sort of run for ages and ages and in fact he says he's over two hundred years old
erm ah we haven't quite got to it
right so how does
how does george feel about UNK father and how does this illustrate it
to say that UNK father going to live for ever
UNK
yes UNK him exactly UNK over him
going on for ever and ever
can't get rid of him yeah and that fits in with what we were saying the other day about the freudian kind of relation between the three of them
nick mean er sorry george needs to in a sense replace UNK father
erm the only way he is going to be able to do that is when his dead
spoke in terms of his career and in terms of his marriage
and the very last point
i think i mentioned it before if you didn't get it down then just put a jot down now
there's this interest in on 's part in how the two sexes communicate
a across the sexes and b amongst themselves and here george goes on
one of the things i do not know about them that's women is what they talk about and why the men are talking
i must find out some time
alright so there's this interest in what women talk about when they're by themselves and when UNK comes down she wants to know what the men have been talking about as well
so it is a very clear interest and that should remind you of who
somebody else you've studied i know you did it with me
interest in UNK interest in what talk about me yes
and then UNK voice what do you want with a not very good american accent and that's it
right thank you very much
be before we start can i make two quick announcements one er i made at the last lecture that is there is a public lecture given by UNK at five fifteen today on the subject of the soviet union and wh where does it go erm and that's in
the other announcement erm is er dr has asked me to address some UNK no that's not fair some er hard working but UNK students erm tt er who are doing a political processes course a sort of pale UNK of this course erm probably find none of them are here today let's b let's not be shy now is erm is ian here
is james here
yeah
good
is UNK here
right
is UNK here
is christian here
at least they're consistent in their UNK aren't they
er is tim is tim here
right
well those people i've who are here erm i'm told by dr and i'll read this because i can't understand it myself political processes please remember he says that tutorials for part three commence next monday and tuesday the twenty first and twenty second but papers for only two of the seven groups are currently in the folders
if you have not completed your paper then please do so without delay
papers are missing from the names i've just read out
if you have removed a paper from one of the folders please return it immediately
alright
if you want to know what that actually means see dr but he asked me to read it out
okay this is the fourth in our series and the second on the presidency and i want to do two things in this lecture
the first is to spell out to you the precise erm constitutional position of the president and the second and perhaps more interestingly is to talk about the notion of presidential power
erm now i know that most of you have UNK the constitution but because i suffer from UNK i had to bring mine with me to remind myself erm what the constitution says about the powers of the presidency
erm now what powers are given to the president of the united states by the constitution of the united states
there's to be a special er sweet or something bar of chocolate for those who get these questions right
what powers does the constitution of the united states give to the president
not a single offer
gives him the executive
first sentence of UNK article two section one says the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america full stop
right later on it describes in enormous detail how the president is chosen and the electoral system and then under section two it gives several specific powers that the president has and i would like at least one contribution from this packed assembly here
commander in chief of the armed forces
commander in chief of the armed forces
the president of the united states is commander in chief of the armed forces
or act as it actually says in the constitution the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the UNK of the several states erm there wasn't an UNK then so by extension it's assumed that he commands the UNK as well
okay commander in chief
right
we're making progress
another power of the president given to him by the constitution
yes that's dealt with actually under the leg legislative section of the constitution but still i i'll buy er i'll buy that
nominations
nominations to what
UNK
yes
UNK
yes
working hard this man
who's gonna help him
what do you understand by the term nomination
does he have the power of appointment
right i shall read UNK all together UNK this in your sleep he shall have power let's read it all he shall have power by and with by and with the advice and consent of the UNK to make UNK he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the UNK shall appoint UNK other public ministers and UNK judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not UNK otherwise provided for
interesting isn't it
the president of the united states is not free to appoint whoever he chooses as secretary of state or secretary of the treasury or as director of the c i a or director of the f b i or the secretary of defence or the justice of the supreme court or UNK to london or anybody else except by and with the consent of the UNK
so remarkable restriction
does the president of the united states have any powers over the congress
does he have any way of controlling or directing what congress does
at the back there
the UNK yes we touched upon that that's stopping the congress from doing something rather than making them do something
no
so you can't dissolve a congress there's a fixed term i'll read you what the constitution says it says the president shall from time to time give to the congress information on the state of the union you may have heard of the famous state of the union address to congress that the president makes on an annual basis and he shall recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and UNK
so this is not a power here this is again it's a recommendation as with the appointment it's a recommendation to the congress
and i think what that UNK in the constitution is that the founding fathers who devised the constitution saw the congress as the central organ of american government and they saw the presidency as an UNK
and i think what i was trying to say get over last time was that this has been in a sense practically inverted in american politics today
that the presidency is now seen as the heart of the american system and the congress is seen as a sort of unfortunate if necessary check and control on the presidency
but if you think about it in contemporary terms i was giving a lecture in london er a couple of weeks ago erm on the subject of erm UNK changing foreign policy under clinton if you just think about foreign policy making and who makes it and questions of consistency and you think about some of the UNK that are going on in the world from bosnia and so on what does the constitution tell us
the constitution tells us that the president of the united states is commander in chief of american armed forces and as commander in chief he can despatch american armed forces to any part of the world he chooses to
there's a nice story about my one of my favourite presidents i told you last time UNK roosevelt got very frustrated with congress so he sent the american navy he had no money they wouldn't give him any money so he sent the american navy to the UNK and he said to congress if you want them back again you'd better vote some more money cos they haven't got any fuel erm which is a fairly odd way of proceeding one might think
so if you think of it let's just take these in turn the president is commander in chief what does that mean
can the president of the united states commit america to war
who UNK the war making power
and the answer is the congress
so although the president is given by the constitution the power of commander in chief in the same document at the same time congress is given the power to declare war
the president it says in the constitution which i've just read the president has the power to make UNK to make agreements with foreign countries
we've seen UNK on er nuclear UNK we've seen UNK on control of the UNK in recent years
the president has the power to make UNK but the constitution says only if those UNK are approved by two thirds of the UNK
and if you want to try to understand say something like the er UNK scandal then part of the roots of that scandal lie in the american constitution in the way that there is th that the president is controlled by other aspects of the constitution
the president is not free to choose to start wars wherever he feels like it the president is not free to make agreements with any country he feels like making it with and some presidents have had to learn the hard way
if you remember your from your history at school the first world war the americans in the historic role of arriving at wars rather late erm came in to the first world war to win it for us erm and after it president wilson who used to be professor of politics at UNK just put that in er president wilson created essentially cos we were all bankrupt at the time as usual er the americans the only ones who had any money left at the end of the wars erm president wilson helped to create the league of nations the UNK of the united nations but the u s UNK refused to UNK the agreement
the american president was then left with a situation in which he'd created a club which he UNK he himself couldn't join
er so that there is built into the constitution then checks and controls on the president
and if you look at the literature on the american presidency in the post second world war years you will find two themes two related themes
one is a theme of er presidential frustration the idea that the presidency of the united states is too weak an institution to cope with the responsibilities that it faces
and this was a particularly popular view in the nineteen sixties and you found lots of people arguing that the american system needed reform that here was the president who was UNK by congress or in the er in the er question i've set in the in the programme you know the president is less UNK in UNK you know as more like UNK in UNK erm that the president has enormous responsibilities that the nation looks to the president the world looks to the president but the president can't do anything and that you need an increase in presidential power
now that was true until the late sixties early seventies and of course er you find there the election to the o to the white house of one richard UNK conservative republican er a man who was not above UNK and UNK to do his work for him and this produced a reaction and if you read the presidential literature of the nineteen seventies you will find the opposite you will find er political scientists all american er demanding reforms of the american system not to make the president more powerful but to make the president less powerful
indeed the best selling book of the nineteen seventies in american politics by a famous UNK arthur UNK junior called it was called the imperial presidency
you don't have to read the book it's rubbish but i mean you can just say if you remember the title the imperial presidency here was a view that the presidency had become dominant the presidency had grown out of all proportion to the intentions of the founding fathers and needed to be UNK back
and then of course you've got UNK and history ended with UNK
the what you've got here was an ideological debate
in the nineteen sixties you had UNK this is a broad brush approach you had liberal quote unquote progressive quote unquote presidents faced with conservative UNK and the conservative congress was preventing the liberal president from taking action
ninety five percent of american political scientists are liberal democrats they didn't like that so they wrote books UNK congress and saying the president ought to have more power
but then the good old american public elected UNK so here you had al UNK in the white house and these same political scientists wrote books saying hey hang on when we said more power to the president we meant more power for our kind of president you know jack you know and l b j and the boys not this UNK tricky UNK character
what we want here is controls on the president
er and it's very odd very odd because you know there's an ideological reaction
faced with a conservative president the liberals want to control the presidency faced with a liberal presidency er conservative congress want to control the presidency
so there's a there's a tug of war here and it's partly institutional it's partly a UNK presidential conflict and it's partly a liberal conservative conflict about the nature er of the presidency as an institution
okay well let me say something now about what political power means er to an american president and what its limits are
and what i will do is to look erm tt in some detail at er an analysis of a man r called richard UNK i mentioned last time mr shirley williams and richard UNK wrote a book in nineteen sixty called presidential power and that book is now in whatever what it is i don't know seventh or eight edition and it's probably still the single best selling book on the american presidency and er for good reason because it raises an argument which is really quite simple but often UNK
before i do that let me just UNK and say one word about books i've had a few people ask me about books erm i gather that the distinguished durham UNK have sold out of my wonderful book but i gather that lorries are UNK up motorways with
planes are landing as we speak erm there are an enormous number of books on american politics most of them are identical er with different covers
it takes at least five americans to write a book erm they're all multi UNK volumes erm for most of your purposes for almost all your purposes er and certainly for basic reading for lectures and tutorials it really doesn't matter which one you read erm there are i mean there are in the library i think the last time i counted them about twenty five or thirty general UNK on american politics it doesn't really matter er which one you read
some are better than others and one of course is UNK distinguished
okay
let me then say a little bit about UNK and presidential power and if you remember my last lecture i said that he was the man who UNK the phrase that presidential power is the power to persuade
now er dick UNK er didn't invent that phrase he got it in fact from president harry truman tt erm in the nineteen forties
truman once said he was asked what the job of the presidency involved and truman once said i sit here all day trying to persuade people to do the things they ought to have the sense to do without my persuading them
but the word persuade occurs several times
why because i have in the previous discussion we've just had i UNK the limits on presidential power on direction
what er UNK does though is something quite interesting he says well we all know well i hope you all know that there are limits on presidential power and we all know that the president can't direct congress we know the president can't appoint anybody without consulting congress we know the president can't control the supreme court we know all these limitations but nevertheless leaving that to one side pushing that to one side there are major powers here
commander in chief of the armed forces let's take let's take er cases of presidential power being used by presidents to see what it in fact means in practice
and i'll just discuss briefly two of the cases that he uses and they're you know they're old now i haven't read the most recent edition of his book he might have updated his case studies but it doesn't really matter he takes two cases er one relating to erm the conduct of the UNK war in the nineteen fifties and the other relating to the UNK of southern schools also in the nineteen fifties as examples of presidential power
now let me just let me just run the story by you
here comes a brief history of the UNK war starting in about yes about ninety seconds on the UNK war erm north korea UNK south korea and won
the americans decided that an armed resistance was necessary and they went to the united nations shades of bosnia here they went to the united nations to get support and as luck would have it the UNK were UNK this was quite common in the nineteen forties and fifties and the a the soviet UNK to the u n was having a UNK and was refusing to attend the security council and he therefore persuaded the security council to pass a resolution er producing a united nations force to aid UNK little south korea against its vicious UNK northern neighbours and so the UNK war started and the united UNK forces were UNK by one general douglas macarthur general douglas macarthur in case you don't know won the second world war single UNK
er it's not funny he believed it
erm he won the second world war in the pacific and after the war he became UNK of japan well that wasn't his title but that's how he saw it
tt and so he was then sent to er to er wo mi UNK up this little UNK in korea
tt with the aid of the good general the er united nations army and the south UNK pushed the north UNK back into north korea and er UNK view was well while we're winning why don't we keep going you know perhaps we could take over china as well
erm and the north UNK were going backwards at a vast rate of knots and in came the chinese the chinese army it stood at that time i think at twenty five million men erm and douglas started losing again sad really isn't it
er at this point douglas said er he thought it'd be a jolly good idea if they dropped a few of these new bombs that they'd discovered at UNK and UNK er on these UNK people and that would really show them who was in control of the world er now this as you might expect caused something of a problem to president truman
now president truman er was a man of erm limited intelligence but extraordinary courage and UNK and erm er his previous career involved a failed UNK store which went bankrupt er and then acted as a bag man for a sort of organized crime in UNK city but that's you know you've gotta get on the job training somewhere haven't you
anyway he wasn't UNK he was not UNK by the UNK of japan sorry douglas macarthur as er as a very impressive figure
in the end harry truman decided that he really couldn't stomach any more of douglas macarthur this guy was clearly off the planet you know er and so er president truman sacked macarthur and er replaced him as commander in korea
and this is an ex example as er UNK first presents it of presidential power
here is a man he's commander in chief he's the president of the united states he's faced with a UNK and difficult general who was UNK the purposes of his campaign extending the campaign beyond proper limits and the president has to show who's boss and he showed him who's boss and he sacked him great presidential power in action
but there's a fly in the UNK and the fly in the UNK is that general douglas macarthur was a war hero general douglas macarthur was one of the most popular men in the united states and harry truman was one of the least popular men in the united states
er harry truman could've run for the presidency in nineteen fifty two but chose not to
he chose not to not because he wasn't enjoying it he loved it but he chose not to because he knew he would lose and part of the reason knew he would lose was because he sacked douglas macarthur
one of the consequences of UNK douglas macarthur was that the u s congress called UNK on television into UNK conduct of the UNK war and UNK public UNK fell even further
when douglas macarthur returned to america macarthur had not been back to america since nineteen forty one this is ten years later he'd been running japan in the meantime there was one of these huge UNK tape UNK in new york he was the welcoming hero and president truman was seen as the UNK and some analysts argue that decision that single decision to sack macarthur may well have cost harry truman the american presidency
and that's presidential power
the other example that er UNK uses is about UNK in southern schools
here what we had was a case of the supreme court well i'll say more about this later but the supreme court UNK by race to be UNK and requiring that these decisions be recognized and enforced by relevant authorities
most of the southern states UNK this and in one particular state one that's UNK to UNK in recent times the state of UNK er and its capital little rock the then state governor who wasn't then bill clinton but a man called UNK the supreme UNK order and on a historic day in nineteen fifty four a little UNK of black children UNK up to the local high school and were met by armed police and turned away
president UNK who was also a war hero er republican president er when he heard of UNK erm actions er he er he sent federal troops to little rock UNK and on the second day of the school year federal troops in full combat gear you know with machine guns and all the rest of it and er UNK and stuff UNK the black children into school
and this was another demonstration or confirmation at one level of presidential power
here you had the governor of a state in a federal system choosing to act in a particular way and the president overriding him and demonstrating his power
well that's certainly one way of looking at it erm but it's not the way that UNK looked at it and it's not the way that many people looked at it erm tt afterwards
erm i think the point that's being made here is that even within the defined areas of authority given to him by the constitution the president finds it very difficult to act unless certain specific conditions are met
erm the president finds that people only obey his decisions if certain conditions are met and these conditions rarely come together
let me let me just illustrate that in the case of UNK macarthur and in the case of sending federal troops to little rock to des UNK schools the orders were readily carried out
macarthur didn't say to truman hey you can't sack me i'm the UNK of japan no
i've got the divine right of kings or something
he recognized the president's authority
he didn't always recognize the president's authority there's a wonderful there's a wonderful true story of er at some point in the UNK war truman flew out from UNK and macarthur flew out from er korea and they met in one of the pacific islands i forget which one i er wake island i think and on the runway you had the president's plane at one end and UNK plane at the other end you see and truman sits there waiting for macarthur to come to him and macarthur sits there waiting for the president to come to him you see and nobody moves
so after about half an hour of this truman sends an order saying tell that son of a UNK to get over here
and UNK macarthur agreed to come and talk to the president
but when the order came signed by the president you know hands up who's commander in chief not so fast macarthur you're out of a job erm macarthur accepted that
when er the army was instructed by the president to go to little rock and enforce the UNK of schools they went and they did it
but how often how often are UNK decisions or orders UNK with
and only if certain conditions are met i would argue or as richard UNK argued and i agree with him so he must be right erm the first is that in this decision the president's involvement was UNK there was no question about it that here you had the president directly personally involved in a one to one communication
how often has that happened
most of the time the president works through other people
so you're sitting in your office and some you know your boss comes in and says hey the president says so and so but the president doesn't usually say it to you he says it to somebody else so there's always there's always a possibility of ambiguity somebody else has interpreted the president's message in a particular way
but these cases douglas macarthur had his piece of paper harry UNK signature on the bottom you're fired
you know this is not capable of many different interpretations it's clearly not a promotion you know it's clearly not a reward for good behaviour you know it's a it's a UNK
the second is the second condition is that the president's language was plain and simple
there was no question of er again ambiguity creeping in
there's the classic story of erm at the time of the UNK missile crisis er UNK in nineteen sixty two said to jack kennedy hey you want us to get our missiles out of cuba why don't you get your missiles out of turkey
you know you're worried about us threatening you on your borders you've been threatening us on our borders you get rid of yours we'll get rid of ours fair
seems reasonable
eighteen months previously president kennedy had ordered the withdrawal of the american missiles in turkey but eighteen months later those missiles were still there and when kennedy was presented with this bargain bargaining counter by UNK he sort of shouted at his UNK of staff and secretary of defence and anyone else he could shout at and sort of said what the hell are those missiles still doing in turkey i told you eighteen months ago for god's sake get rid of them
and his adviser said well mr president you did say we should get rid of the missiles in turkey but you didn't say when you know you didn't say by tuesday morning at ten o'clock or by next week or in three months' time you just said withdraw the missiles from turkey
and what happened in practice was simply the turkish government made representations to the state department and said hey you know these bases they provide a lot of work you know we have to provide UNK alternative employment for these people so could we phase out this withdrawal over say a three year programme
and the state department said sure you know cos they didn't have a deadline the president hadn't given a deadline
so that's usually the way things happen the president can't spell out things and dot the is and cross the UNK
so two conditions then the president's involvement is UNK the second that his language is plain
the third is that a president's decision is widely UNK
the UNK of macarthur was a public UNK it was intended to be a public UNK of macarthur and that's what it was
but most government business doesn't take place on television most government business takes place behind closed doors
in most cases on most issues nobody knows what the president has decided
only his immediate UNK and staff know that
and where the president speaks publicly then his orders are obviously much more likely to carry weight than if it's simply behind closed doors
the fourth factor is that there's really no point in giving people orders or making up policies or decisions unless the people who receive the orders have the resources to carry them out
and in this case it was no big deal a company of soldier you want a company of soldiers to go to little rock
no problem
you want er you want a letter carried by hand and given in to the hand of douglas macarthur
i think we can manage that
i think the resources of the american government can manage that
but if the president says hey you know go and win the war in vietnam for me you know that's a bit more tricky a bit more tricky
doesn't automatically follow just because the president UNK a wish that it that it happens
and er UNK then the fifth condition is that those who receive presidential orders were in no doubt about the president's authority to give those orders
the president here remember is working under his powers as commander in chief directly from the constitution and nobody questioned it
if they had questioned it the chances of the orders being carried out would've been much less of course
so these are in a sense then the five factors making for compliance
five factors which make presidential power er a reality
erm and the question of course is you know how often do these circumstances occur
how often does presidential power take this form
er and the answer is not very often
that er in the ordinary course of business life is different
and that although these are cases of power the president has done er what he wanted to do people have UNK him things have changed something's happened in both cases you will find that the actual order was the last thing the president wanted to do
douglas macarthur as i said was the most popular man in america
what harry truman wanted was for douglas macarthur to behave himself he wanted douglas macarthur to stop giving UNK press conferences he wanted him to stop UNK strategy as he went without reference to the president he simply wanted to restore the chain of command
and he sent er memo after memo to the UNK in korea advising them of what the guidelines were what they were allowed to say what they weren't allowed to say and so on
he had this meeting on wake island that i described to you when they wouldn't get out of the planes all attempts to persuade macarthur to behave in a reasonable fashion
but he didn't
and truman felt that his authority as president was being directly challenged and he had no alternative but to sack macarthur
but his decision to sack macarthur was a failure in persuasion
he had failed to persuade macarthur to do what macarthur should have done
and the similar tale can be told of the UNK in little rock
general UNK d UNK when elected president of the united states had absolutely zero interest minus zero interest in the question of racial integration
president UNK took the view that what happened in the states was really a matter for each state to decide
he was very concerned that the integration of the races might lead to violence and public disorder on a large scale
he spoke publicly about the need for each state to work out its own solution and erm earlier in that year in fact it's nineteen fifty seven i think i said fifty four before er earlier in that year nineteen fifty seven er UNK said in a speech in r in response to a hypothetical question he said i can't imagine any set of circumstances that would ever UNK me to send federal troops into any state to enforce the orders of a federal court
and six months later he did just that
what had changed was two things one that the governor of the state had talked about UNK the court rather than actually do it and secondly that UNK had UNK to see him at camp david the president's summer UNK in UNK and had a weekend of talks with UNK now i wasn't there i was at primary school then but i wasn't there as far as one can piece it together what UNK said to UNK was you know i don't really care what you do but i don't want it on prime time national television i don't want a scene i don't want you to UNK openly publicly to UNK the order of the court
there's more than one way to prevent UNK to prevent integration you can draw school boundaries in certain ways to effectively UNK schools if you want to but let's not have this macho stuff on the school steps armed guards you know er i mean er the pictures of UNK that's the only expression for them i suppose UNK of white people you know throwing bricks and bottles at seven and eight year old black children on the way to school i don't want i don't want i can do without it
and he spent two days trying to impress this upon UNK and UNK went back to UNK and did exactly what he said he was going to do
and this was UNK by er president UNK as a direct UNK to him that he had tried to solve a situation a difficult situation by persuasion and he'd failed
and so UNK was gonna get the smack of firm government and the federal troops went into little rock and sorted it out
now that's not what president UNK wanted i've just read out this quotation it's the last thing i want to do he says but he's driven to do it because the state governor refused to accept the arguments that UNK put to him
so what er richard UNK is saying in his argument is and go back to the beginning of this lecture is to say the constitution of the united states makes life extremely difficult for any president
there are a whole range of things he can't do he can't direct congress he can't appoint who he wants freely he can't make UNK with whom he wants when he wants he can't start wars if he wants to start wars all these controls are on the president but what i what er UNK is saying is over and above that even in the areas where he appears to have constitutional authority as a matter of practice it's very difficult for the president to exercise his authority and when the president does exercise his authority he does so at great cost to himself
it's damaging to the president to UNK power over people
what is the lesson of all this according to richard UNK the lesson is that techniques of persuasion are really the essential UNK of any president any president who wishes to be successful
and you've got in at least two of the last three presidents in president clinton and president UNK two presidents who UNK understand that who absorbed that message they are great UNK
they may not persuade you but they are great UNK
UNK er was the master of persuasion both through er his control and confidence on television and so forth but also in one to one conversations with er cabinet members or with er members of congress or whoever
a man of great personal UNK i'm told
bill clinton UNK a huge amount of time in persuading people he likes to work he likes to work in teams and groups he doesn't like to sit there giving orders
if you sit at the white house in the UNK office and give orders then nothing will happen
you have to persuade people and persuasion is a constant process and so clinton is permanently engaged in persuading people to do the things they ought to have the sense to do without him persuading them
okay thank you
right can i have your attention please
last week if you remember i was talking about the primary concern of the state a concern er which is UNK is a concern for its security and i said if you remember that there was an approach er UNK the study of international politics called UNK which stressed the importance of what has been termed the power security hypothesis
and if you remember i said that because of its concern for security the state creates a capacity for violence in the world of states its environment and since this is er erm a characteristic of all states however large or small the resources they all create this capacity they all have a defence policy er there is a UNK competition and this competition far from UNK the problem of security in fact UNK it makes it worse and so states find themselves competing at different levels er competing particularly in the creation of military capabilities and the consequence of this is a more or less sustained and permanent arms race which frequently er produces armed UNK and war
now this er capability is not solely designed er for the protection of the state the defence of the state
that is its primary function that's its primary purpose but it has a secondary purpose as well it is concerned for the pursuit of what are now termed er in the jargon sub strategic objectives
that is er objectives which are not directly concerned er with the safety of the state er but with er certain of the state's needs a as a state er defines them
er and so er although in security UNK in the event of war we find er that these wars tend to become total wars and we've had two of these in the present century historically speaking in recent times we had another one anyone know what it was
mm
a total war
outside of this century
UNK
yes that's right
the wars with republican france and UNK lasted for nearly twenty years and although erm er temporary UNK and UNK were negotiated the struggle continued until the UNK of UNK and that was although it was a largely european war it did have UNK it brought britain for example into war with the united states in UNK in eighteen twelve
erm and i suppose you could regard the thirty years war too er as being a total war in this sense in that the objectives of the war is the UNK of opposition UNK surrender
well fortunately these wars are fairly rare except perhaps in our present century
er but the most characteristic kind of war er our i is rather limited war a and violence need not necessarily be expressed in the form of erm a formal attack it can be used of course to threaten or to UNK
and so we have a dimension of politics in international politics and within the state which is related to securing objectives which are not directly connected to security using the means of violence
and the sorts of objectives that er these wars are concerned with er may be control over resources over particular minerals control over markets con control over trade the acquisition of territory or the recovery of lost territory and ideological or political objectives which are strictly speaking er to do with the belief system which UNK in particular states or where there's a conflict between states er which have UNK conflicting er UNK
erm the problem for the state in using violence in this limited way is first of all of course creating a capability to achieve by threat or use of violence limited objectives
now this is a problem er because if you don't UNK define your objectives and if you don't know what you need to achieve them then you're likely to UNK into the possibility of an UNK war e even into a total war whereas the original objective was not in fact er as serious er as er as that
erm in short we're talking here of the concept of rational war
now what is rational war
UNK defined this as a UNK between means and ends
now by that he meant that the ends sought should be closely defined and should not change and the means adopted should be effective and they should not change and the consequence is that UNK then move into er conflict but the conflict itself is self limiting in the sense that one side will accept defeat er and the consequences of victory and clearly these consequences are not so severe to the state as to UNK its existence
if the means themselves are changed if the war moved into a total war phase then of course the security of those states engaged in that contest is immediately threatened
erm a classic example is of course erm the second world war
none of the UNK intended to fight what was called the second world war they all entered into conflict they all began er a UNK programme with the idea of using violence as a means to secure lesser objectives
now what where these objectives
so far as hitler was concerned and he was certainly the person who started the war his objectives were was to achieve a form of economic UNK which involved the UNK of er territory in europe er but which would not push his UNK to the point of fighting a war of national existence
he really believed that he could do this through the form of the UNK that is through a limited war er which would secure military objectives and then produce a political peace and the model er for his er policy was in fact the eighteenth century where many wars occurred between european powers wa UNK imperial wars and wars on t on er total europe but none of these wars resulted in the destruction of any state
only one state disappeared
anyone know which state it was
mm
poland
yes poland that's right
poland disappeared for over a hundred and thirty years in a series of UNK erm er between it's ne er by its neighbours and wasn't restored in fact to political existence until the end of the first world war
er so states could re resort to war and these wars were limited
but of course limits are self imposed they depend very much upon political will as well as upon resources
there were some er structural factors in the eighteenth century which limited war for example governments could not easily tax erm raising taxes by usually erm er UNK by er UNK er kings and so on was not a popular move as the previous century had shown
er people did not in fact wish to pay taxes in order to allow erm their UNK to play the game of war and the limited sums of money available for these wars was soon UNK so when your cash ran out then you sued for peace you engaged in negotiations
another factor of course er was the fact that no state then could UNK could in fact force people to serve in its UNK and so on erm UNK was limited
there's a host of factors of that kind which in fact kept the er conflicts to a minimum i in terms of their extent in terms of the damage they did
frequently UNK thought it best if they were UNK to in effect accept an honourable surrender er and er UNK of this kind occurred from time to time between largely UNK
well what happened to change in fact this er notion of limited rational wars with the means ends in balance etcetera the kind of erm UNK days if you like to which UNK wished to return
well the french revolution occurred and what the french revolution did it transferred UNK a huge assets to the to the er government it allowed UNK a people's army and it also turned the biggest country in europe er biggest with the exception of UNK russia er into a war state
if you remember the attempt the first attempt to UNK the revolution came from outside it came from UNK foreign UNK and this gave them a hell of a shock the re the revolutionary government
we had the terror and then we had a series of successful wars which put france as a dominant power in europe and brought inevitably er its neighbours er those that were able to fight into a permanent UNK
in other words we have modern UNK first make its appearance
now the assumption that erm UNK made about the future of europe was europe with france as the leader and this is an assumption which challenged directly the political integrity of all the other european states
consequently that war or series of wars er was a total war
equally in nineteen fourteen when er the UNK belgium he made a direct threat towards british security
as i said last week he c he er made it appear to the british that he s sought to control the channel ports and with a large navy was then capable of UNK with our trade and in indeed mounting an invasion and that brought britain into a war which could not be ended until the germans sued for surrender and vice versa
now the point i'm making here is that security competition creates a capability which is designed to defend the state and that capability comes into direct conflict with non security objectives which are er supported by threats er of violence
in short the limited war always has the potential to become a total war
i'm speaking here of the period of conventional UNK by the way this is not the case with nuclear war as i shall show in a later lecture
well let's look at a few examples i'll take the UNK war of nineteen fifty to fifty three the UNK missiles crisis which although was not an actual war very nearly threatened a nuclear war of nineteen sixty two and the vietnam war of nineteen sixty three to nineteen seventy two
now the UNK war was a limited war in that the united st neither the united states nor the soviet union wished in fact to fight over the UNK
what actually happened
the whole story is not yet known although it's claimed that north korea er UNK south korea er i sh i should take that as a hypothesis and not as a fact
however the event erm was that north korea rapidly er UNK most of south korea until the united states decided to intervene
now it used the united nations as its cover and it's fortunate in that the soviet union was absent from the security council and so was not able to UNK the resolution which authorized american intervention
now what kind of war was it going to be
the united states got the united nations to adopt a resolution which called for the UNK of north UNK troops from south korea that was the objective that was the immediate war aim
how could this be done
it was done in fact by a brilliant military er UNK er and indeed the americans succeeded in throwing the north UNK back over the UNK the river UNK so up to that point limited force had been used to achieve a political objective the objective was to s to erm contain communism wherever communism looked like UNK over into other countries non communist countries
but then president truman made a big mistake he got the united nations to UNK another resolution which called for the UNK of korea erm through united nations intervention and american forces crossed the UNK
now the big mistake was this it wasn't of ve of very great importance who governed north er north or south korea er they weren't particularly important strategic areas they didn't have er important ports or er or base facilities or any resources then erm the mistake was in fact to directly challenge chinese security and if you looked at a map you'll see in fact how this er came about
as the UNK american troops poured towards UNK the north UNK border with china then the chinese beg began to become increasingly UNK at the at the notion of a united korea right on its doorstep
it warned the united states through the indian UNK to the united nations that if this advance continued that china would intervene
the united states ignored the warning and the chinese forces then made their successful assault and defeated the american troops very badly driving them in fact into the south
the war that followed was a UNK both sides lost enormous casualties and the chinese lost far more than anyone else but the united states wound up that war with forty thousand american dead and with the only er partial success of managing to ma maintain the status quo in south korea
it was a case do you see of the end itself changing in the course of a war
now what are the means
while the american forces are being defeated its commander in chief then called for the war to change its character
general UNK the use of the atomic bomb against UNK and against chinese targets
so worried was the united states allies that the british prime minister flew er to the UNK states to washington to er tell president truman that if the united states used atomic weapons in that war then this would seriously affect the alliance the nato alliance
in other words we were we were considerably concerned about the extent of the war
now you can see what would have happened if UNK advice had been followed
the original objective was to UNK south korea it then began to unite korea but if you raise the objective to an assault on china proper then you would have to quote general UNK who was a commander on the spot er you'd be fighting the wrong war the wrong time and in the wrong place
what would be the purpose of that UNK
and the answer was nothing unless you actually wish to attack china and er defeat china through military means and the task of doing that of course was enormously out of proportion to the original er cause of the war
er the UNK missiles crisis
now here you had a very different situation because the nuclear dimension was now starting to become very important
the erm UNK of that crisis was the attempt made by the soviet union to UNK erm medium range missile bases on cuba
and president truman sorry er president erm kennedy er a democrat it's democrats that always seem to get involved in these kinds of wars as was the case in the vietnam war erm er president kennedy in fact took this to be er a radical change in the strategic balance and th this is the way the crisis was represented
but in fact the problem was the position of UNK and of the communist regime in cuba
the er UNK claimed that these missiles were not offensive and indeed the weren't offensive
the united states had the same sort of missiles in italy and in turkey and before this crisis had developed president kennedy had in fact ordered them er to be er returned to the united states these missiles had no strategic purpose at all because a major change that had come into the strategic equation was the arrival of the UNK missile and it was these missiles really which held the strategic balance er and were to change in fact UNK both international politics and global strategy over the years to come but i'm going to talk about that later the point i'm making here is that er UNK claimed that the missiles were there in the event of an american assault on cuba they were a deterrent weapon in exactly the same way as the defensive deterrent weapons er were d were defensive er for er the united states and for the soviet union
and the context in which this was er argued er was er the bay of pigs invasion of cuba a c i a american supported invasion er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the american desire to get rid of UNK and er UNK was UNK in effect that he had as much right to defend an UNK as the united states had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way
now kennedy had a dilemma although cuba was in the UNK and although the united states had the biggest navy in the world and the biggest UNK and was easily able to UNK cuba if it wa if it wished to it was vulnerable however in other areas in particular it was vulnerable in UNK and it was vulnerable in UNK china
in nineteen sixty one prior to the crisis the americans had to face the rather UNK settlement in UNK by which they accepted a communist erm er government or at least a government which had communist members erm kennedy wanted to intervene in UNK but again was UNK by his british UNK wouldn't in fact accept er that we should get involved in a ground war in UNK china
er in the case of UNK the er situation there was er that russia er of course the soviet union could intervene in UNK more or less at will given that it was a small island in east germany and was always a vulnerable always in a position of being a UNK
so kennedy couldn't act UNK he couldn't simply do what he wanted to do which was to get rid of UNK because if he'd done that then his policy objectives in other parts of the world would be in UNK
he couldn't threaten the soviet union directly because the soviet union was a nuclear power and couldn't be threatened er so the course of action he took was intended to be moderate and to secure the objective solely of removing the missiles from cuba not of doing anything about the UNK government or the regime or anything of that sort
and so they came to a negotiated settlement by which the UNK agreed to withdraw the missiles and the united states promised that they would not interfere with UNK again although from that day to this they have maintained of course their economic UNK
er and here you have a case of UNK er and the UNK of war and possibly nuclear war erm UNK out
limits were set in short by both sides on what they sought to do and how they sought to do it and these limits erm weren't self evident at the time i can tell you because the american military the UNK of staff on the executive committee that discussed this an and took the decisions were all in favour of making s air strikes on these bases and possibly er an er an armed intervention and so the military advice here er was er was rather similar to that of UNK that is turn the crisis into er a different kind of crisis turn it in fact into a war
now thirdly the vietnam war now this was perhaps the most UNK war the americans ever got themselves involved in and has had deep and permanent effects upon american policy making to this very day
now what were the limits so far as the vietnam war was concerned
well initially the united states genuinely believed that with a small force perhaps about a hundred thousand maybe two hundred thousand troops but principally using air power that they could prevent the north UNK from helping the UNK in the south and thus continuing the civil war
now one can make judgments about means and indeed as i was saying in my last lecture the actual capability of the weapons you have can only really be found out when you use them and then you can see very often that they are in fact UNK
now wa the erm war began with operation rolling UNK and this was erm er president UNK plan er to pound major targets in north vietnam by aerial UNK and make the cost of their intervention in the south very high so high that they would cut off the UNK cord and UNK the UNK into submission through ground operations in the south
that was the basic plan
he started off as did truman in the united nations by trying to get the security council to adopt a resolution er calling er the north UNK and UNK er an american i e u n intervention
this failed
it failed because the french and the british were unhappy about supporting such a move and indeed the united nations looked very likely er to be more erm willing to condemn the united states than it was to condemn north vietnam but the view of most countries in the world at that time was that north UNK that north and south vietnam were part of the same country that the UNK in nineteen fifty four which called for UNK should be UNK and that the united states was UNK in a south east asian country for no good reason
so it is a hostile atmosphere and so hostile was it in the united nations that the americans decided to UNK it and what they did was to UNK erm an article which called for the removal of votes from those states who were in who were in arrears in the payment of their dues of their funds and there were several countries in that category two of them the soviet union and france and the reason why they had not pal paid their dues was because they objected to the use of the these funds for UNK forces which had not been authorized by the security council in their argument the security council was the supreme authority and the general assembly had in fact not the right to UNK er UNK activities and indeed if you read the charter this is the case although legal advice is conflicting on that point as it usually is
erm well the solution to that was to hold the meetings of the general assembly where the hostile american majority was but not to permit a vote to be taken on any resolution and this meant that president UNK could pursue his then secret plan of bombing the north without any hostile united nations resolution being passed against it
two years later the americans quietly dropped the whole issue and the un returned to normal but by that time of course the situation had become what it was er a war
well limits then so air UNK and the use of some ground forces but principally to get er the south UNK army er to contest er the UNK on the ground
well that failed as you would imagine it to fail if you take the civil war in vietnam as being in effect a war of national UNK as the UNK called it because what the north UNK wanted was in fact national unity
they were fighting for an objective which was far more important than local arrangements or local agreements er with er foreign imperial powers about who governed what er in their own country
and so they were prepared to go on taking the punishment taking the cost because their objectives were ha had a different scale of value to the objectives sought by the united states
two or three years later with half a million troops they are still no further forward in their struggle in vietnam and the cost this time was to the united UNK political system because the effect upon domestic politics was fairly severe
after the north UNK revealed that they were able to sustain erm a w er their war in er erm the south it seemed regardless of what the united states could do to them er after they'd revealed this in the UNK offensive of nineteen sixty eight then president UNK announced he would not be standing for re election and that was a significant admission of political defeat and if you remember well you probably won't remember but you certainly should've read about it president UNK was returned with a majority er on the platform of ending the vietnam war
the casualties i think were something like fifty seven thousand dead and a very large number of people wounded because of the particularly UNK kind of war with all kinds of weapons being used
now why was the united states defeated and was this war a rational war
well the objective was the maintenance of a friendly regime er in a country which had become part of the american sphere of influence
no one however at the time questioned why it was necessary to do that
what was the significance of keeping south vietnam in the american fold
no one asked that question they simply focused upon er the communist UNK in the south and the american commitment to the global containment of communism meant that they had to go and do something about it and domestic political pressures were there too er president kennedy came out of the UNK missiles crisis a hero because his people UNK believed that he'd won a foreign policy success and that he'd acted in a UNK and UNK manor
well regardless of the UNK and the rhetoric in fact it was an american defeat er he had to accept the existence of a communist regime in cuba and to keep his hands off it
now in the case of vietnam a decision had to be made to intervene or not to intervene
if they'd not intervened er then indeed the consequences would certainly have been a communist victory so the intervention was necessary to maintain that policy position
what limits would be placed and kennedy was very UNK conscious of the big mistake that truman had made in korea in fact seeking to extend the intervention and bringing china into the war under no circumstances must china be allowed to take that step in the case of UNK china
now this meant that the UNK of UNK and UNK er the main er route the main supply route er from china the most of the UNK incidentally came from the soviet union china provided the facilities er so under no circumstances could the americans intervene there nor could they cross the UNK zone in force and erm UNK north er vietnam as they had done with north korea previously
now these limits were fatal they believed that they could win the war through air power and they couldn't and the ground casualties although fairly slight when you think of it fifty thousand people killed is not a bi a large amount in a major war far from it erm although erm UNK not that significant politically they were UNK because people in america started to ask the question what is this war for
er and this of course er became er a major domestic political crisis as well a difficult military situation a difficult one to win
now the points i'm making here firstly we have the problem of UNK security from non security er objectives
we have the problem of defining and keeping er established limits so that the pursuit of a non security objective does not lead you in to directly erm having to er fight a security war or a total war
now it's true that since the second world war all wars have been limited in one sense or another but then comes the question if you do in fact succeed in defining objectives er and de in defining the means to those objectives how can you know in fact that you possess genuine capability without putting it to the test without actually fighting the war and then finding that you cannot win it
you can't win it by changing the parameters er if you do change the parameters of course then you'll be fighting a different war and your objectives then become different
erm the problem of limits then erm is UNK when yo you're UNK threatening or using violence
think of the present problem with bosnia there isn't a single er advanced industrial country that wishes to get engaged in ground UNK in yugoslavia because there would be simply no point in it and any casualty er would be seen as a waste as a throwing away of resources and you'd have many casualties it's argued
it's argued that you'd need at least a force of eighty thousand troops that's in bosnia
erm well why would you er get engaged in a contest erm with er the three UNK because you certainly wouldn't be able to con UNK yourself to one and since there's no national interest as such i know there have been many attempts to link er bosnia with er peace in the world generally or with world order in fact there is no threat er this is a civil war strictly speaking and th there's no evidence that it would er sp UNK over into a major war unless it was made a major war er by those er with the er forces that exist
erm so how then do you stop the fighting
how do you secure order
and we now have got the first step er sorry not strictly speaking the first steps of course were economic th that we had a strategic UNK and an economic UNK er on er on the UNK and er on the er the different regions er th the first military step however is air strikes and we'll know er within a week i think whether in fact this step will be actually taken or whether the threat is sufficient to UNK er the UNK to come to a negotiated settlement
it's a fairly low risk erm threat at the moment air strikes are cheap er they're not particularly dangerous whether they're effective or not is another matter er and there's no immediate come back on the domestic scene because no one is expecting any one state to be the saviour in that particular situation
er the united states er in short the principal er UNK here er is immune from criticism because if these strikes fail it's simply er bad luck erm there's no cost to the united states that can be translated into the domestic er arena and made dangerous to the UNK president
er this tells us that domestic political considerations are very important in deciding whether to use er violence or whether to threaten it or whatever erm so there is er a domestic political dimension to this which is well worth examining if you wish to understand the limits that actually exist on UNK powers
erm secondly erm if you do get engaged in a contest the consequences of failure should be weighed before you actually get involved
in short if you er ta er taking er UNK decision over vietnam if he decided to do nothing this would have been very damaging to him politically because of the declared er policy of the global containment of communism and the expectations of his domestic public that the united states would take action to defend the free world wherever the free world was challenged without much questioning about what the free world actually was i mean the fact that er south vietnam was run by a rather UNK was neither here nor there erm so erm you have to er evaluate when you're UNK er actions of this kind what failure would mean in domestic political terms
now mrs thatcher certainly did this er when she authorized the UNK
the consequences of failure there wo would certainly ha have meant her removal from office erm however she did calculate erm that within the limits she set that success would be wo would in fact be the result and it was
it was a strictly limited operation
the UNK mainland was not threatened er the major erm influences in the region were UNK particularly the united states
the force levels were added were sufficient given the UNK of the UNK government to reinforce er the UNK once the action had begun and again the equation of air forces etcetera were UNK
i think she had a fair amount of luck but luck is always an el element in anything of this kind
erm the demonstration effect of failure should also be considered that is if you fail once you've undertaken an enterprise this will affect your other policy objectives too that is er you will be seen to be weak your commitment to intervene on behalf of other allies might be seen to be to have UNK er and generally you might have done your overall foreign policy stance er some considerable damage
erm the world is indeed inter related erm we are talking in strategic terms of a UNK er erm system just as we as when we come to the later lectures we will see as is the case with economic relations
what a country does in one part of the world UNK throughout the system
er there are interests all over an and some er have a higher value er and some have a lower value but they are all related erm so it's not possible to regard er a contest solely as an isolated UNK struggle where you're weighing up the UNK the relative forces the relative military capabilities that exist you have to consider a whole range of political economic and strategic effects of your action
erm UNK another example of a successful war was of course the gulf war
now here again calculation of forces er and er the er conduct of operations was in fact strictly limited
the UNK were not pursued into their own country er the attacks made were largely erm the fairly cheap and as we now know fairly UNK er air strikes and that the main contest was in fact over UNK which was indeed the declared objective er of the whole operation
in fact the erm er the actual agenda was far more to do with the price of oil than it was to do with er who ruled UNK
erm but the point there is that UNK were observed
bush said this will be no vietnam and he well understood and everybody else well understood what he meant by that
erm the limits the means the ends were held in a UNK relationship and so we have an example if you like of a rational war a war in which the objectives can be er successfully UNK er without them changing er and the means held
well that's as far as i want to go with this particular topic erm as is my practice i'm ending now so that we can have questions
erm i'm ranging over a lot of what for you perhaps is historical material given your age but er you're probably not very familiar erm if you want to ask questions about er detail or whatever please feel free to do so
there are a number of books on contemporary world politics and you've got some recommended er for you to read
who'd like to ask me a question
cos i'm not recording this for myself it's for a UNK who wants the department's lectures on tape for some reason
before we start this morning i'd just like to make one brief announcement er one of my colleagues has asked me to announce er a lecture to be given on thursday at five fifteen that is er directly after the second systems lecture of the week erm on the title of the transition from UNK to democracy changes challenges and opportunities in the former soviet union and it will be given by the UNK of UNK erm and that's er at UNK fifteen one four one in this er in this building
thank you
this is the first of er two lectures on the american presidency and erm i want to begin just by putting the presidency in context erm thus far i hope it's clear that the american UNK political system is one in which authority is firstly limited by the constitution in which authority dispersed by the by virtue of the separation of powers
we know that the congress has the legislative power but the president has a UNK
the president according to the constitution has the executive power that executive power depends to a large part on the willingness of congress to provide the legal framework moments in which there is harmony and cooperation between president and congress tend to be exceptional rather than er a regular feature of the american system and if er the president manages to get something through congress you can bet that very quickly the president will face some defeat in congress shortly thereafter to remind the president that the united states does not have contrary to the popular press does not have a presidential system of government
and what has happened over time is that in the twentieth century with the UNK of two world wars with the impact of the worst economic depression that the world's ever seen with the rise to global dominance both economic and military indeed one might say UNK the rise to global dominance of the united states the scale and er scope of the u s executive branch has grown and with it an increasing er attention and focus on the presidency
that's understandable and to some extent UNK but if it creates the impression in anyone's mind that the u s has a presidential system of government er then they would be sadly UNK
the am american system is one of as i've said a dispersed limited and shared form of authority and the president is but one UNK and in UNK case not a very good one in that particular er set of arrangements
okay i think what we've seen in american politics in the last twenty years or so is a an in is er an increasing UNK of politics the er the mass media the so called er UNK er focus on the daily lives of presidents
we know much more about the state of UNK teeth than we do about the state of the nation
we know much more than anyone could possibly want to know about bill and UNK sex life er than we do er about prospects for economic recovery and this has happened to UNK american presidents and it happens in part because in the u s the president and his family and it has been a his so far the president and his family take the part not only the part played in england by the prime minister but also the part played by the monarchy
the president is both head of state and head of government and in that capacity serves to some extent as a symbol of the nation a focus for loyalty and americans have a curious capacity for er im UNK to whoever wins the presidential election a set of er outstanding qualities
so that every american president is a sort of half breed a cross between daniel UNK and jesus christ and that however UNK and UNK a politician he might have been before once he assumes the white house it is assumed that he changes
they talk about people growing in office always worried about people who think that forty seven year old men can grow but there you are
er the office itself the UNK of the office UNK the man
so even someone as obviously UNK as richard UNK people started talking about the new UNK new UNK the UNK
they stopped saying you know would you buy a used car from this man and started talking about him as the international UNK
and this means or this has an impact this dual role as head of state and head of government has an impact on what any president can do
because a very large part of any president's time is taken up in the UNK in the ritual in meeting heads of states from other countries from opening the UNK of garden UNK receiving parties of boy scouts er and whatever else the queen and her family do these days
er and that means that the president's attention is both diverted from substantive concerns and it also means the president there's a UNK on the extent to which the president can appear to be UNK
so the president tries to UNK the national interest to UNK the common good and he puts forward policies not in any spirit of er personal or UNK advantage but simply for the good of the nation
and so you have then a political system in which you which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful UNK a president who is not part of UNK but who has to lead the UNK without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task
erm one of the best known UNK on the american president a man called richard UNK er who's occasionally known as mr williams because he's married to er shirley williams a UNK out social democratic politician of er UNK erm richard UNK once said well once said many things but er on this particular occasion said that er if you want to know what presidential power is it is simply the power to persuade and that er when you look for er an american president what you need to look for er is not somebody who is clear minded far sighted and so on but you need somebody who has the capacity the skill the talent to persuade other people to do what he wants them to do
it has to be persuasion because he has few if any powers of UNK unlike the british prime minister
okay well if we look into the development of the presidency what we've seen is a gradually changing conception of the office
er i said i think in the first lecture the founding fathers saw the presidency as a check as a control on the UNK er and er in periods of crisis UNK find it very difficult to respond
any group of five hundred and thirty five people find it difficult to agree on a common purpose or a common decision and increasingly in period of crisis attention turned to the presidency and presidents were not always willing to supply the leadership er that er the country expected
erm presidents of the nineteenth century very often took the view that the president was not much more than a sort of constitutional UNK er a UNK part of the constitution to use er UNK phrase
erm in the eighteen fifties in the years immediately UNK the american civil war the er then american president er was placed under great pressure to do something about the increasing UNK and increasing conflicts between north and south but er he declined to do so
does anyone remember the president before abraham lincoln
not many people do
erm his name james UNK james UNK was asked to do something about the UNK of the UNK law this is the one that returned UNK back to their owners erm and UNK said i quote UNK limited and UNK as is the president's power under our constitution he alone can UNK but little for good or for evil on such a UNK question
after all he is no more than the chief executive officer of government his UNK is not to make but to UNK the laws
congress alone has the power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectively the objects of law
apart from the execution of the laws the executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the federal government and south UNK any attempt to do this would be on his part a naked act of UNK
so you have a very particular view of the constitution that given by the founding fathers and one which is still in force some seventy eighty years later as america headed towards its most UNK and UNK crisis in its history
now this is a turning point in american history and er UNK the time UNK the man and the man in this case was abraham lincoln and abraham lincoln took a rather a rather different line
and i shall quote to you from er a message of UNK to congress in eighteen sixty one and from some of his er private correspondence
if you remember the question that the founding fathers faced was how do you create a government which is strong enough to UNK and to defend the nation and defend the country yet a government which is not so strong that it UNK the rights of individuals within it this is the essence of the problem of government as the founding fathers saw it
during the er civil war abraham lincoln er suspended UNK without consultation er suspended the writ of UNK corpus who knows what UNK corpus is
right to a fair trial any advance on that
we must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely
mhm
it literally it literally means produce the body only you can't simply well the difference between a constitutional system and er an arbitrary government is that in arbitrary governments people get arrested and disappear locked up throw away the key and worry about it the next generation or after the next er military coup or whatever but in a constitutional government there have to be procedures and one of the UNK of individual liberty is that if you're ever arrested and UNK by law enforcement agencies you have to be produced before a court within a specified period and charged with something
there has to be evidence produced to say why you are being UNK and you have a chance to UNK that evidence
er as you can imagine in the circumstances of the civil war the government the federal government was much UNK about the question of UNK and fifth UNK and people er in the in the northern states er engaged in UNK and collecting UNK of various kinds so er lincoln suspended the writ of UNK corpus
there were UNK people were UNK er without trial they weren't charged with anything but on suspicion of being UNK for the UNK
and lincoln was criticized attacked for this that er and he said in response to this the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is UNK as the constitution says to take care that the laws be UNK should himself not UNK those laws a fairly reasonable proposition you might think if your UNK says to UNK the law then you start going round breaking the law er something wrong here somewhere UNK
he goes on to say of course federal laws were not being UNK in the UNK because they'd rejected the entire UNK of federal laws and lincoln goes on to point out must they these laws and the UNK be allowed to state the question more directly are all the laws but one to go UNK and the government itself to go to pieces less that one be UNK
so you get the impression here of lincoln talking about an unusual crisis situation in a letter to one of his mates in eighteen sixty four lincoln goes on lincoln goes on to in his letter to a friend to deny that civil war was fought to free the UNK er as a moral UNK he wants no part of that argument
lincoln says in a letter to his friend er UNK in eighteen sixty four quote i am naturally anti UNK
if UNK is not wrong nothing is wrong and yet i have never understood the presidency UNK upon me an UNK right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling and i UNK that to this day i have done no official act in mere UNK to my abstract judgment and feeling on UNK
i did understand however that my UNK to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law
was it possible UNK question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution
now here we move in to a bit of plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be UNK to save a life can you guess what's coming next but a life is never UNK given to save a limb
pretty acute stuff eh
i felt and this is the bit i like i some i used to set this at one point in the examination question and ask people to guess which american president said it i'll read i'll read it to you measures otherwise UNK might become UNK if UNK to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation just i'll just get the essence of that measures otherwise UNK might become UNK if UNK to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation ninety percent put richard UNK er no one put abraham lincoln er cos he was one of the good guys right or wrong i assume this ground i could not feel that to the best of my ability i had even tried to preserve the if to save james UNK is essentially the UNK pilate of american politics he says yes these are very acute problems er and very difficult er and i'd like to help but i'm sorry i can't and i really do have to go off and wash my hands now erm and you know you carry on and when you've resolved it tell me what you want me to do and i'll
i'll do it
lincoln takes the opposite view lincoln says here is a crisis the person UNK placed to deal with major UNK in american politics is the president and i UNK lincoln stand forward and i'm prepared to do almost anything if in my judgment it's necessary to preserve the nation and the constitution
so from a view of the president as UNK and UNK and UNK you have a view of the president as being er the action man the crisis manager and it's UNK view the UNK view of the presidency which has survived er an and developed with the odd the odd UNK back to a previous a previous age
and you find UNK presidents er claiming some special authority that the constitution doesn't give them but which they believe that er a UNK to them by virtue of they're being presidents
one of my favourite presidents UNK roosevelt president from the early part of the twentieth century and known as the UNK erm you might be interested to know how people become president erm UNK roosevelt was an arch UNK and got very excited about the er war with spain er america had a s little brief war with spain at the end of the nineteenth century erm over the possession of cuba and erm in eighteen ninety eight and this UNK great UNK feelings in all red UNK americans and especially in UNK roosevelt and er roosevelt formed his own company of UNK called the rough riders and erm roosevelt wore glasses and was UNK but he had this group called the rough riders sort of early kind of UNK stuff and erm anyway he g he was engaged in the war with spain er and there was one wonderful moment in the war spain in which the UNK were at the top of a hill called the UNK hill er and er teddy as he was known of course he gave his name to the teddy bear did you know that did you
you learn something every day in these lectures
er teddy roosevelt down at the bottom with the rough riders the guns at the top of the hill the horses at the bottom of the hill you've heard of the charge of the light brigade haven't you
they were smart guys compared to teddy roosevelt
er teddy roosevelt leads a charge of horses up hill up hill into the mouth of the spanish guns smart guy smart move how did he become president after doing something as UNK as this
well fortunately the spanish were even more incompetent than he was and what the spanish commander instead of rubbing his hands at the prospect of er the damage they were about to UNK he discovered that they had the wrong UNK for their guns and roosevelt and the rough riders UNK the spanish guns a and teddy roosevelt became a war hero and on the strength of becoming a war hero he become vice president of the united states got the vice presidential nomination and in good american fashion the president was shot er by an UNK er and teddy roosevelt became president so there you are there's a there's a career plan for you to er to think about
erm roosevelt was er despite the er rather unusual route to the presidency really rather a good president but he had a he had a very particular view of the presidency which was one which he shared with lincoln but he took up UNK arguments and developed it further and i quote from er UNK which is rather more UNK than most UNK erm roosevelt wasn't modest i should say in case you if you wonder when i read you something
he says in the UNK erm my view was that every president was a and this was a famous phrase every president was a steward of the people a steward of the people bound actively and UNK to do all he could for the people and not to content himself with the negative merit of keeping his UNK in a UNK curious turn of phrase i decline he says to adopt the view that what is UNK necessary for the nation cannot be done unless the president can find some specific UNK to do it in the constitution
i did and caused to be done many things not previously done by the president
i did not UNK power but i did greatly UNK the use of executive power in other words this is the UNK part i acted for the public welfare i acted for the common UNK of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was necessary unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative UNK roosevelt suggested that the president subject only to the people of the united states and he identified himself with andrew UNK and with abraham lincoln
to roosevelt the view UNK by our friend james UNK was UNK in which the president was the servant not of the people but of congress and this to roosevelt was
so you get if you like a development here er of presidential authority and the perception of the presidency both from the point of view of UNK and from the point of view of the american people and gradually in the twentieth century you get an increasing focus an increasing focus on the presidency as the engine of government that it's the president who makes things happen it's the president who UNK things it's the president who UNK to UNK and as the UNK become more frequent and the UNK become more intense so the focus on the president also UNK and the UNK view is now no longer UNK the UNK view it's not possible for any president to play the UNK
they like to do it a bit but they really can't sustain it because ultimately there's a there's a call for action a demand for action
in the twentieth century er the president who did most to develop the office further was UNK roosevelt UNK cousin er and UNK roosevelt who became president in the nineteen thirties and the time of the great depression and remained president for till nineteen forty five so he was president for thirteen years er and his political UNK were so upset by this that they actually amended the constitution afterwards to prevent any future president from serving more than two terms of as president so eight years is the maximum that anyone can serve as president
roosevelt served for thirteen years and led america through the depression into the second world war and emerging at the other end as
my lord
my lords i beg leave to ask a question standing in my name on the order paper
my lords her majesty's government takes every opportunity to promote good quality religious education in schools
in particular local authorities in england and in wales are required to review to their agreed UNK for religious education the school curriculum and assessment authority has been asked to develop model r e UNK a new circular has been issued to give guidance to schools on their duty to provide religious education and the inspection system will monitor and identify any school failing to do so
my lords i'm grateful for that helpful and encouraging reply erm would the noble UNK agree that many teachers do not feel who are not specially trained in this area do not feel comfortable delivering the r e syllabus
could she tell the house what action is being taken to ensure an adequate supply of suitably trained teachers to deliver this important and sensitive subject
my lords the point made by the noble lord is that it is an important one erm it is important that teachers do feel comfortable with this subject and to that end the erm grant for education support and training is making money available and religious education has been added to the number of subjects for which it can be made available to help with er improving UNK in schools but also pr improving co ordination for religious education in schools
my lo lords is the minister aware that er a survey of the religious education council in nineteen ninety three found that more than half of the those teaching religious education in secondary schools have no formal qualifications in the subject
would she accept this figure which is lower than any national curriculum subject is bound to affect the quality of r e teaching and er can she give the house an assurance that this matter will be addressed urgently
what i can say to the right reverend in response of that particular survey
first of all there is no overall shortage of UNK religious education specialists both in terms of those recruited to i erm initial teacher training and those employed within the schools
it is true however that the january survey which is erm which took place very recently erm there were only fifteen vacancies in the subject in this in the country overall it's also true to say that of thirteen thousand one hundred religious education specialists in the country only half of them were actually teaching their own subject
so it's not a shortage of specialists it's a shortage of the erm importance both l e a's and schools give to the subject and make sure that the UNK are used in the right place
er can the minister in fact i mean following that question can the minister say in fact how many teachers are teaching religious education in private schools are not in fact UNK qualified for the subject at the moment
my lord the number will be a great many primary schools teachers are of course UNK er UNK not specialists and a primary school teacher with only religious education as a UNK would be disadvantaged quite seriously in having to cope with teaching maths and english and science and history geography art and music and so on
what is absolutely erm essential is that we do more to provide good quality support teaching materials and advice and that the grant that i mentioned earlier is made full use of so that UNK and co ordination can be much improved in primary schools
my lord my lords to what extent is the teaching of religion in primary schools confined to the religion of the er to which the child has been UNK has been brought up erm and er would it not be better if it were confined in that way and if the teaching of other religions were UNK until the child were older and in the secondary schools
hear
hear
my lords i can give my noble friend an assurance that christianity as the main traditional religious tradition of this country will be taught at every key stage both key stages er at key stages one two three and four and that er knowledge of other religious is also a requirement but i can also say to my noble friend that model UNK have just been released for consultation and there is a real concern which i share with my noble friend that young children at the ages between five and eleven are required to cover too many religions and that's a question that will be covered during the consultation period
does the noble lady agree that this subject is different from all the other subjects
it isn't merely a matter of training and qualifications it's a matter of religious commitment as well and most teachers nowadays take the view that to try and teach this subject without that religious commitment is sheer UNK
hear
hear
that is the problem
hear
hear
hear
hear
hear
hear
but i think it's important to make the distinction learning about religion or actually teaching for belief
it is learning about religion it's an educational process and it has an importance whether it's learning about religion and whether its learning it as a cultural historical and a religious er tradition of the country and that is what is important
it really must be for the churches and the families themselves to go much further and to instruct if that is the er what the noble lord is UNK at erm promoting belief
hear
hear
my lords er would my noble friend subjects are nevertheless best taught by those who have a sympathy for them and in the light of the fact that eighty per cent of er school pupils in the primary sector are taught th all subjects by the same teacher
would she encourage an increase in the twenty per cent who actually employ specialists for particular subjects er to do so as a priority in religious education where the teacher has no such sympathy
m my lords first of all the there are a number of reports out now very erm good reports that do encourage primary schools to look and exploit the UNK of the teachers on their staff and that would cover of course people who have a UNK in teaching this subject and it is also true sadly in the case of some schools who won't allow er people who are specialists in the subject and can speak about it with authority for example er local UNK and UNK and faith UNK who can come in help in a school but where those schools do ex exploit the expertise in the community the school is UNK by that
hear
hear
does the noble minister not agree that this area of education is absolutely central to our future as a stable multi cultural society and that therefore teachers must have in depth knowledge of the traditions and UNK with which they're dealing
doesn't this emphasise the absolute importance of the relationship between higher education and teacher training
my lords it really does erm it's a matter of professor not professor UNK on this occasion it really does depend what you mean by multi UNK er can
can i say that as long as the integrity of each religion is preserved then education is a very sound er erm is very sound in prospect but sadly it has become a UNK pot and as my noble friends like to refer to it a UNK and i don't think it does anything more than serve to confuse children if it's done badly
what is absolutely essential is that the integrity of each of the religions are properly preserved when they are taught
yes but is my noble friend aware that the point of view expressed in the question put by the noble lord and my noble friend the noble lord would represent the point of view of most parents who are concerned about having religious education at the beginning
m my lords i it is important that whatever is taught to a child between the ages of five and eleven that the child is able to benefit from it UNK if the child is UNK as it were by being presented erm a curriculum that they simply cannot manage then that's going to create confusion but it's also important to say that one of the erm er objectives of this whole exercise is to UNK all education both morally and UNK and i believe we're doing a great deal to get that right
my lords may i ask my noble friend the minster what arrangements in the teachers training colleges how are the teachers going to be taught teach religion those who and want to teach religion
er m my lords there are two things one is that if it's an r e specialists of course it will be their primary subject
if it's erm if it's a school teacher as in primary schools where they're going to teach a lot across a range of subjects one of the new measures i think is going to help and that is the introduction of the sixth subject erm UNK of education degree because maths english and science will be the core three subjects and the other three subjects will be of choice so there's an opportunity there for one of those subjects to be religious education and it will be taught in greater depth to those teachers
next question
UNK of
my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper
my lords the government er plans to dispose of the land st UNK site once it is no longer needed for the building project the british library is preparing a case for retaining some of the land for further library buildings
we shall of course consider the UNK proposals carefully when they've been UNK
my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer as far as it goes however is my noble friend aware that three important functions o of the british library namely the national sound UNK the UNK processing unit an and the er conservation are er not going to be included this p or in other parts of london and cannot be included in the present building
would it not make administrative sense if at least part of this site could be reserved specifically for the british library so that in any future extension these units could be incorporated
my lords the case for UNK the areas that my noble friend spoke about will be considered when the british library has completed its investment appraisal for use of the surplus land
they are operating satisfactorily from their present locations
my lords i took the opportunity knowing this question was coming up last friday to spend an entire morning on the site in the building
hear
hear
er am i brought back a pack full of UNK information for your lordships which i have placed in the library this library not that library
aware that erm the retention of this site is essential for expansion since the british library after forty years in construction has room for will have room only for twelve hundred readers not many more than great russell street while the french national library which has taken only five years to build and will be completed next year will have room for three and a half thousand readers
is it therefore not essential that this new site should be used for an additional reading unit
hear
hear
hear
hear
my lords it's a question of cost in the long run but er the reason that the our british library will have fewer than the french library is originally it was planned to have three thousand places but er further er examination which has really been taken undertaken very thoroughly has proved that this is really not necessary
my lords may i declare an interest in this question as a user of the british library
is the noble UNK aware that a national library must grow
may i UNK also ask her to bear in mind that none of us are in a great hurry to go through again the expense and the UNK of the UNK of the british library and if this land is not made available to the library that might happen rather sooner than we wish
really answer the first part of the noble lord's question by saying that er it is a question of future cost er we are er we are already spending a great deal of money on the first part er of this er library and er we will have to examine the future cost very carefully and i put it to you to the noble lord that it would be a really sad reflection where the field of creative endeavour in which this country is m has most UNK over the centuries in other words literature to have no single focus for celebration preservation and active use it really is er very important that this library continues but may i remind your lordships also that we're not talking about the s the library in this question we're talking about the u the site at present used by the builders
the case that most people regard the way in which the national library has been built and planned as a total national disaster and a vast waste of public money
no my lords i entirely disagree with the noble lord er furthermore as i've already said we're talking the builders site not the library in today's question
my lords government is not prepared to retain the land itself for the future development of what must be regarded as one of the world's greatest libraries
would it at least give a UNK assurance and preferably in this house and now that the british library will be given the opportunity to raise funds to purchase the land itself so that the future development of that library will be possible
hear
hear
the government would be prepared to consider proposals er for private funds but the british library would also need to prepare a business case showing how it would meet the cost of the building and the ongoing costs
my lords may i ask my noble friend if it wouldn't be better really to lease the land for a period of time perhaps long enough for the UNK felt about the cost of the library as it currently stands and when perhaps more optimistic views could be UNK because the piece of land it's on is not going to be UNK once it's sold
it was a unique happening to find thirteen acres of land together in the site and it's not going to occur again
the drawing together of the parts of the british library has largely been achieved by the existing structure there still are large bits
i'm particularly concerned perhaps if i may ask her to show some concern for this herself that the UNK of the newspaper library way up in the UNK further regions of the northern line the great virtue of the existing site is that's on the inner circle the UNK of this site is really its greatest virtue
my lords the present building meets the british UNK key requirements
it is already library policy to operate from the two sites london and boston UNK there is room for expansion at boston UNK
there's another element which your lordships have not touched on to do with this land which is why er we are being very cautious about our plans for it and that is that er the union railways have indicated a requirement to lease two point eight acres of the land for site purposes from nineteen ninety seven to thousand and three er but this will depend on the timetable for construction of the channel tunnel link
my lords is the er noble minister aware that the site er which is referred to is not of great market value in the sense that it is scheduled by the planning authority for use only as an open space or for community housing
is she also aware of the fact that the national sounds UNK now housed in exhibition road in south UNK ought really to be next door to the music library and it has always been the ambition of the library to put it there and that furthermore and here i speak from great knowledge because i negotiated the arrangement if that site at exhibition road for the national sounds UNK library is sold that money can only be used under the term of that agreement to provide similar accommodation elsewhere
in other words both the land is cheap if it is realised and secondly already the british library has an asset at exhibition road which can be used to UNK the cost of some of the building
will these factors please be taken into account
hear
hear
the fact is er the last fact is that the noble lord mentioned will be taken into account
the current value of the land is estimated at one point five million but the land at the time of any sale would be determined by the most favourable planning consent which can be obtained at the time
my lord
my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper
my lords the aim of the government's policies is to ensure that patients receive high quality accident and emergency services whenever they need them
we're continuing to make take action to develop and improve standards and conditions in accident and emergency departments
my lords whilst thanking the noble UNK the minister for that reply would she not agree that when they get into hospital the accident case or the UNK emergency case they've probably been sent there by a doctor and that there they should th therefore be handled but what the associations are concerned about particularly the royal college of nursing the b m a and unison is that emergency and accident cases are put in corridors on UNK and this ought not to be th a situation which can be UNK
would at least the noble UNK be prepared to have a look at that what appears to be and i have made some investigations a somewhat UNK situation
hear
hear
yes my lords and certainly undertake to do that
i would like to set this into context though because over thirteen million attend accident and emergency departments annually
er the government find it absolutely unacceptable for people to wait on UNK once the decision for admission has been made er but my lords sometimes it is necessary to wait er for observation purposes or sometimes for diagnostic UNK er which actually have to take place in the a and e department er but my lords it's very interesting to see how similar hospitals vary even within the same vicinity and we believe a great deal of this is due to poor management
my lords is there not a danger at looking at er accident and emergency departments in isolation from the rest of the hospital
if beds are blocked by for example UNK patients er in medical or even UNK wards won't there be a UNK effect and therefore it will be impossible for the patients who need to go up to these other wards to get out of the a and e department
my noble friend is absolutely right er it is a er essential that the erm hospital does have a good discharge policy that there are community facilities to support people once they leave hospital er and my lords we know that with some of the new procedures that are now being introduced er that is possible and that when a patient comes in for treatment a discharge policy is worked out almost immediately so that the support services can be given when the time comes for that person to leave
has the minister er studied the royal college of nursing report which was published early last month which shows that in a third of accident and emergency units in hospitals patients actually have to stay overnight er before they are admitted to er a ward and would she a accept that this really is not a satisfactory situation it's actually worse i outside london than it is in london contrary to some views
the average waiting time is five and a half hours
is not this really a situation to which er she and her colleagues must er address their mind
my lords i found a very interesting er aspect in the royal college of UNK review was that resources were not the issue the royal college itself came down in favour of the fact that it was management that needed to be tightened up and my lords it was interesting looking at that survey that it was a telephone survey and in one of the two hospitals er one or two of the hospitals that were rung up it was quite difficult to find the person who'd answered the survey
that report er that i it was er said that it m a high proportion of the cases were because of bed closures which surely must be linked with resources
my lords i don't accept that er one can look at some of the london hospitals university college london hospital er where seventy one beds we closed and where we know they have one of the best accident and emergency departments in the country
UNK said she found it absolutely accept unacceptable for patients to wait in the corridor on UNK
did she mean the word absolutely literally enough to prepare prepared to commit extra money to preventing it
my lords i think i made it perfectly clear what i did mean er i did qualify it by saying that of course there are times when patients do have to wait on UNK for diagnostic purposes for observation and for other reasons er but once an admission has been agreed then that patient should be admitted that is our policy and that is what we're working towards
my lord my lords my lords
hear
hear
hear
hear
hear
my lords could i ask the minister if she would agree that there have been some improvements in the accident and emergency departments since consultants were appointed and how many accidents that er there are emergency departments have not got consultants in charge and leave it to junior doctors
er the noble UNK is right erm we do notice that where a consultant is in charge the difference is very great indeed i'm afraid i don't have the figure but i will certainly give it to her er but also we know that where there are er hospital discharge managers where senior nurses are bed managers the difference is really quite considerable er and that is what i was saying in terms of managing the process
my lords is the minister that nearly half of all UNK units are cutting back on operations a third are giving priority to patients of g p fund holders and more than half of the n h s trust er have a facing a steep rise in emergency admissions of the g ps that as they fight to get beds for their patients
does the minister agree with the view therefore that nurses that nurses should be given the authority to admit patients to hospital provided there is a bed without having to wait for a decision to be to be made by a doctor
my lords the g p funding hold er fund holders issue is not an issue in this case er g p fund holders patients have direct access to any departments as do every other patient in the country er where a person needs accidents er and emergency treatment my lords they get it
lord
to ask the question standing in my name on the order list
my lords we will continue to make sure that parents and governors have the opportunities and information to exercise their right under the law to choose grant maintained status
we are also developing a common funding formula for self governing schools which is fair both to the schools themselves and to the local education authorities which is UNK and which offers a reasonable prospect of stability of funding
my lords will the er minister say how much money has been spent on the so called cash protection for grant maintained schools and will she confirm that the one quarter of a million pounds almost a quarter of a million pounds being spent on advertising grant maintained schools is additional er to the scheme to the first part of the question
my lords as only one thousand of the twenty four thousand schools er have opted out during five years of this does not that suggest that the schools themselves and the governors and the parents to whom the minister refers are not convinced of the advantages and in those circumstances was she given absolute guarantee that no opt out will be allowed without a ballot
my lords the noble lord is UNK anxious about this policy if it was as unsuccessful as the noble lord believes he wouldn't be UNK about it and sec secondly my lords on cash protection the noble lord UNK cash protection with money for erm er providing er information to parents
if you take all of the money that has been spent since the policy was established in nineteen eighty eight it still does not amount to twenty pence per child which as i said in a previous erm question answer to a previous question is bare would barely buy a pencil for each child
er my lords the noble lord asked four questions i think it's traditional to answer two at the box
would the noble minister clarify once and for all whether or not the government are committed to free choice by parents in this matter
if they are will they honour their own commitment by recognising that the overwhelming majority of parents want to stay with local authorities and that therefore local authorities should be given all the backing and support possible by the government to make a success of their role in the future
hear
hear
my lords we remain absolutely committed to parents being the key UNK as to whether a school should go grant maintained erm or whether it should not
er the noble lord is not in a position to say that the overwhelming erm number of parents support not going grant maintained because until this year until the new act of parliament er came into place er not all parents were given an opportunity to answer that question er it is now er necessary for every single governing body to return to that question on an annual basis
my lords is my noble friend aware that many parents and teachers who have been deeply UNK and UNK by local education authority schools in fact just set up their own new schools which are providing excellent education and really meeting those parental wishes often with very strong er spiritual and moral values
could my noble friend give an assurance that if these schools wish to take advantage of the new legislation and to opt into grant maintained status they'll be given every encouragement
hear
hear
my lords erm i can say to my noble friend that erm she's absolutely right there is a new er measure the recent nineteen ninety three education act and any application will be considered er on its merits and er and we will continue to support that
on the other point about local education authorities my lords er it is quite depressing i was er visiting a local education authority only two weeks ago where they had a five point educational strategy for the authority one of those points was to oppose at all cost erm parents right to opt out
my lords as we all know having been told twice by our minister that the cost of a pencil is twenty pence will she now tell us what the overall cost has been and is for cash protection for grant maintained schools
my lords i can't give it precisely at the at the d the despatch box it is public information i will make it available to the noble lord and place the answer in the library
could my noble friend er not agree that in fact grant maintained schools have been very successful not only in raising academic standards in helping parents but in actually improving the fabric of the buildings
hear
hear
this is something which has been drawn to my attention on many occasions and would she not agree that there are many of us who very much regret the fact that so many parents er are find it difficult to exercise their right to vote because there is so much opposition er at a local level from officials
hear
hear
to the opting out principles
hear
hear
m my lords erm on the second point my noble friend makes that's absolutely true and it really was again quite depressing to see that erm er a member in the and the other place mr don foster on behalf of the liberals had actually written to every single chief education officer er concerning anti er concerning campaigning against er the opting out policy as to the other point my noble friend makes it's absolutely true that erm all the service that have been done and there's one very recently reported that the amount of value for money o obtained for every single grant maintained school UNK the l e a maintained schools
erm er government is going to allow the electoral
UNK of UNK parents when they make every other affair a matter of competitive tendering
my lords i i'm not sure that i can give an absolute answer to that it would be wrong for me to guess
as far as i know they have been er certainly have been erm involved in most of the UNK so far but i know there is a discussion going on about whether they should be the
what we need to be certain about is that whatever society is involved in or whatever organisation is involved in UNK that it should be seen to be done properly

i beg leave to erm move this amendment
i erm am raising this issue today in order to give the government the opportunity of telling the house what action they are proposing to take in respect of a serious error which has been made in the rail privatisation legislation
an error which has led or will lead to the powers of arrest of the british transport police being UNK
as from the first of april this year the british transport police will only be able to arrest offenders on british rail property but most of the property of british rail will as from april be owned by rail track
from that date the british transport police will not be able to follow alleged offenders to their homes interview them and when appropriate arrest them
for the department have
transport has UNK removed their powers as constables
this will create a truly remarkable situation a police force of two thousand two hundred officers will at a stroke have their powers removed
let me illustrate the UNK of the forthcoming situation
there are twenty three police forces in this country which are smaller than the british transport police
the transport police investigate more crime than twenty four other police forces
in nineteen ninety two ninety three they were called upon to investigate one thousand two hundred and thirty seven crimes of violence i exclude for various reasons those committed on the london underground
in addition they had to investigate three hundred and eighty eight sexual offences nine hundred and twenty eight UNK three thousand and ninety seven burglaries two thousand eight hundred and sixty two cases of fraud and thirty seven thousand five hundred and eighty two cases of theft
yet i repeat as from april as a result of the government's own legislation they will in the overwhelming majority of these cases no longer possess the powers of constables and thus be able to follow through their investigations
now a number of questions arise from this unhappy situation
firstly how did this extraordinary mistake came to be made in the first instance by the department of transport
i would be grateful if the noble earl who will i assume be UNK on their behalf i hope he will be able to explain this matter to us
er second what action does the government propose to take to UNK this situation
i hope that we will be assured in UNK terms that er government members will be introduced to this bill probably at the report stage
third assuming that amendments are introduced to UNK these errors what will happen in the period between april and the day when this bill gets the royal UNK
presumably the rest of the police service UNK with er investigations of crime as they are will have to carry the burden caused by the department of UNK errors
i would be grateful if the noble earl was able to answer these questions
next has the association of chief police officers yet been told that as from april they will have to take on this burden of work which has been removed from the british transport police as a result of an error in a government bill
if they have been so informed i would be very grateful if i could be told on what date they were told
i am sure the government will appreciate the UNK that they will feel UNK as they are with work that they will now have to use their UNK resources to deal with criminal conduct arising on the railways and lastly who is going to pay for this work
the department of transport has made a serious error can we be assured that police authorities will receive financial compensation for the work that their forces are now UNK have are going to have to carry out and there is a further matter which i have erm drawn to the attention of the secretary of state for transport in er correspondence namely the need to establish a new and representative police authority for the british transport police
given the creation of rail track the constitutional position in respect of the accountability of and the support for the british transport police is clearly most unsatisfactory
i hope that the noble earl will be able to assure us that on this issue too there will be government amendments on report to deal with this important matter
my lords the british transport police carry out work of high national importance not least in the area of UNK
it is essential that the problems i have identified this afternoon are resolved before this bill leaves this house
i beg to move
hear
hear
amendment proposed page fifty line twenty four insert british transport police the british transport police
my lords i would rise to support very briefly er but er whole UNK the amendment moved by the noble lord
it does seem to me an extraordinary catalogue of errors erm and one can well understand how errors take p er could have occurred during the somewhat co UNK passage of the railways bill er what cannot be understood and what is quite UNK is the fact that no steps adequate steps have been taken to correct those errors and to assure the er continued existence of a er transport police which er h has the sole responsibility for er policing large public spaces in this country and er as the noble lord has made clear er does it honour er very considerable scale very effectively er i hope that the minister will find it possible to make a favourable reply to the arguments which have been raised
my lords the noble lord proposes a number of questions for er in his er amendment and er h his amendment does er highlight a difficulty into which we have er run
i think that the noble lord er wi will know that his amendment in fact as it is won't work because it er appears to treat the british transport police as an area of england and wales er which of course would be UNK but i have no doubt at all that his main purpose of his amendment is to explore the questions about the powers and jurisdiction of members of the british transport police which of course he did as usual most effectively
my lords erm i think that behind this there does appear to be some doubt as to the british transport UNK position in respect of rail track er from the UNK april
the british transport police will continue as a single police force one that is responsible for policing britain's rail network after the UNK april
british rail are to remain the employer of the british transport police for the immediate future in order to ensure that the british transport police will continue to police the whole of the UNK railway er a an order UNK the british transport police force scheme in nineteen sixty three will be laid before parliament shortly
my lords the influence behind the noble lord's amendment is that the british transport police will not have the full jurisdiction on rail track property
er i can assure your lordships that this is not the case
the intention of the british er of the railways act of nineteen ninety three was that jurisdiction of the british transport police should be UNK but we are aware that there may be some doubt now as to the precise extent of the powers which british transport UNK police may have beyond the rail track property
in british transport police may act as constables in on and in the vicinity of rail UNK property and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is at presently UNK er at present er urgently considering in conjunction with british rail and the british transport police whether the wording represents a problem and if it is how best to address it
my lords er my er the noble lord er asked whether the government would bring an amendment er down at report stage
i would just tell him this that er there is a problem here which my right honourable friend is addressing and depending on the outcome of those consultations and discussions will obviously depend the action which we will have to take
the erm problems only recently b been identified and it is one to which a solution is being sought
my lords i wonder if i could ask a practical question arising out of this
until an hour or two ago i certainly didn't know that this problem had arisen but the date april has been on the UNK of my er honourable friend er and of the noble minister er i used to represent part of the city of leeds and honourable er a and noble lord you'll have heard recently of behaviour at UNK road football ground on the death of sir matt UNK and one can only wonder what sort of people er we're dealing with but many of them arrive at leeds city station on the day of a match and they come early and they have then to get their way to UNK road and there are often real problems
i've seen out in the street UNK er mounted police charging down rather like the battle of UNK and inside the station problems arising and it's nasty to be involved and in those days i've travelled on a saturday afternoon often
this date of april i can understand the minister er the minister of transport is concerned but unless something is done pretty quickly there'll be a lot of people in leeds who will be worrying about what's going to happen on er around the station because there is this small group of people no not always from the town concerned or the city concerned who behave in this UNK way and british transport police have a very good record at the stations and on the trains as they can move from one part of the country to another
will that be all right will they be able to do that after april or i is this problem going to carry on
my lords i hope that i can er erm UNK the UNK of the noble lord erm the th the fact is that british transport police at the moment have control and jurisdiction over all the railway system in and on and in the vicinity of the railway the railway organisation
in other words they are responsible for what happens on the trains or what or happens on the r railways what happens o in the stations
they can actually go and chase after a person outside the station if that is their wish and at the moment that is erm that will continue to be the case
the only difficulty is er the interpretation of the words and er whether or not the words er in the vicinity of is more UNK than we anticipate and it is that point which will be UNK which needs to be addressed but i think i can assure the no noble lord that erm er they w will have full jurisdiction on and in the vicinity of the stations which is the point which she which she is anxious about and that will continue just the same after april the first before
my lords erm i don't propose to erm develop this argument further this afternoon
the noble earl has said erm er two things that the as i understand it that there is some doubt about the situation
well according to the british transport
there is no doubt about the matter at all that power as constables i have been UNK removed by the department of transport that is reality
the second question is the second certainly made by the noble earl was that the department of transport were urgently examining the situation i trust with the home office at the same time and i would suggest that we might in fact discuss this matter if i might make er if i might make this suggestion to the noble earl between now and the report stage so that this matter can be clarified but i am sure that he will understand that we would not in fact be er feel able to erm ignore this issue er in the period between the beginning of the committee stage today and the third reading of this bill we do expect government amendments to be introduced
at the same time i have asked a number of questions which i if i may so have not been answered
i did ask whether the association of chief police officers have been told that they are going to they are likely to have to take over many of the responsibilities of the british transport police as from the first of april
i asked that question it has not been answered
i hope the noble earl will be able to give me an answer in perhaps in correspondence following this also the date upon which at they were informed because i am sure he will realise the implications as far as the rest of the british police service are concerned that as from april of this year they will have to take on a heavy burden of work which is now being carried out by the british transport police
we cannot allow this situation of doubt to continue any longer
i will certainly ask the leave of the house to withdraw this amendment but as i'm sure the noble earl will recognise we will in fact be coming back to this matter on UNK o on report
i beg leave to withdraw the amendment
erm er i is it your lordship's pleasure this amendment will be withdrawn
amendment by leave withdrawn
the question is schedule one with the first schedule of the bill as many as that opinion will say content
contrary not content the contents have it
clause two of amendment number four lord UNK of
my lords the move amendment which is down in my name on the order paper i do have to apologise your lordships to your lordships if th if it's meaning is not immediately clear even to the keen minds which are present in your lordship's house
page two line seven leave out two a and three and insert and three as amended
my lords the my er justification for that is of course that particular clause in the bill which my amendments seeks to seeks to change both are i admit on the face of it entirely UNK
wishing my lords to understand what exactly is the law which we now seek to amend there doesn't seem to me to be all that er elaborate a UNK
i sought the help of the public bill on this and i was referred to erm UNK i in force
nineteen eighty nine edition which is the latest existing in your lordship's house and i found that edition did reveal at what had happened since to UNK to sections two and three
it made however no reference to section two a the notes on clauses were equally silent on er this important matter
i then UNK to understand i er erm sought it UNK volume thirty three nineteen ninety three edition and studied most carefully pages six hundred and seventy five to six hundred and seventy seven and there i found an account of what has happened to sections two and three and also for the first time light was shed upon section two a my lords i have from time to time UNK to express some doubt as to whether our legislative procedures were as excellent as i'm sure your lordships would wish them to be and when i recently suggested in the most mild terms to her majesty's government that they might consider some form of enquiry into our legislative procedures to see whether as they were as high class as they should be erm i was given a very negative reply the clear influence of which was that the our legislative procedures could not possibly be improved and my lords i do really think with respect that is a proposition which is open to doubt
i don't wish to take up too much of your lordships time but could i without er driving your lordships into the UNK into very deep sleep erm er a quote to you one passage from page six hundred and seventy five
it's just er a small section of foot of a UNK which gives an account of the history of the clause in er of the section in the er police act of nineteen sixty four with which we are dealing and of course your lordships will be well aware that we moved on from section er from the sections of the police act we're not dealing with them at all we're dealing with what has happened to those clauses since and i thought perhaps your lordship might your lordships might be interested in the sort of guidance which is made available th so fortunately to us and so that we can have our minds very clearly focused upon the issues
the note to which i refer of six er page six seven five reads as follows the words omitted from sub sections one four and five and the whole of sub section three were UNK and sub section six was UNK by the local government act nineteen seventy two sections one hundred and ninety six one two hundred and seventy two one schedule thirty the words in square brackets in sub section one and in the first pair of square brackets in sub section two were UNK and the words omitted from para two b paragraph two b and the whole of paragraph two c both of which had been inserted by the local government act nineteen seventy two section two hundred and seventeen schedule twenty seven part two paragraph eighteen were UNK
by the local government act nineteen eighty five
sections thirty seven one hundred and two schedule eleven para one schedule seventeen
