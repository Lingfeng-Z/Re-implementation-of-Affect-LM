i mean it's their responsibility to er prepare the local plan in the context of what the structure plan strategy as a whole is saying and i think it's necessary not to just look at this particular policy in total isolation and assume that is going to give er what you fear to district councils the ability to nothing
they are obliged to take the structure plans strategy and proposals on board and to interpret them in the in the local plan in the round
but we heard yesterday mr williamson about a dispute and i can't remember which district council it was with it may have been harrogate between the county and the district councils on one allocation in the local plan
does this policy not in effect strengthen the county's arms in arm in such disputes
could i ask mr potter mr UNK familiar particularly with this i think it was richmondshire wasn't it
i can't remember
yes
yes it was
david potter north yorkshire county council
er yes i raised an example without referring to a specific site and the site is in richmondshire where the county council has objected to a proposal in erm what is a local plan in its very UNK stages and the proposal conflicts with policy i five in so far as i five UNK development to the main towns and urban areas
and i believe quite properly UNK development to those locations
erm the proposal i'm referring to is in the view of the county council in the open countryside
in so far as this policy is concerned i think is all it does is give greater clarity to what is the strategy of the plan and what is perhaps implicit within those other policies
i don't think it adds any greater restrictions to the existing policies
i think when you look at the policies collectively and the policies individually the strategy of protecting the open countryside is implicit within those policies
i think that all that this policy does is make that more explicit it gives it greater clarity
doesn't it give you two policies rather than one to UNK mr earle with or his colleague
in so far as yes two policies would be referred to yes
but the one i think just adds to the other it just makes it clearer
thank you
mr heselton
thank you chairman
terry heselton selby district
i suppose in the in the light of what's been said i am slightly UNK erm particularly going back to the erm i five discussion that we had yesterday and you you'll be aware that part of our objection to the erm the policy put forward by the county council re related to the specific wording of the of the policy and the flexibility available to local authorities in terms of allocating land erm that best serves the needs of potential developers and investors
and i think we did draw attention to the fact that er there may well in some instances be a conflict in terms of what selby district wants and what current p g advice suggests
but then when you refer back to the original restraint imposed by the erm existing policy
so yeah i'm UNK slightly concerned in that respect
i thought you might be with that answer yes
mr earle
thank you chairman
erm the particular case of richmondshire having been referred to i felt i ought to point that er we're quite content with the concept of policy e two as giving the strategic weight to the question of protecting the open countryside and the balance the very difficult balance decisions that we and other authorities are going to have to come to in preparing our local plan
we're quite content that we're going to have to er put before the local plan system the UNK issues and the weight that's given to the countryside through e two is appropriate in the circumstances
thank you
any comment
ah mr UNK
thank you chairman
michael UNK countryside commission
a lot of the dis discussion has clearly been erm trying to resolve some of the UNK in p g seven er and i think perhaps different perception to what sort of countryside in north yorkshire we are trying to safeguard through policies
er on one side there seems to be a feeling that there should be no development and it would compromise the character of open countryside
and on the other there seems to be a view that well erm wherever necessary perhaps on a farm or elsewhere that development should be should be permitted
and the consequences of a latter approach could lead to UNK change in the appearance and nature and character of the countryside so that you get something rather different than most people's perception of a countryside being there for its own sake
and i think that whereas erm we would not necessarily argue with a case for providing criteria at a strategic plan at a structure plan level erm to put some flesh on what is meant and maybe clarify some of the explanatory memorandum in a more positive way simply should ensure that the policy does not dilute sorry that whatever changes emerge does not dilute the mode intention of the policy
and that the district should be given some form of a guide that enables them to be er to apply the particular circumstances to their own district
there may be some districts that have er areas of countryside which are outside the non designated areas which they regard as particularly important as erm the gentleman from selby has said er and the we have suggested that er there might be a criteria in the policy that allows the quality of the countryside affected by development to be a consideration
in other words erm that er special landscape areas countryside is not to change quite UNK
if there is a decision at the structure plan level that the countryside should be enabled to change quite UNK in north yorkshire that would be a different matter
but nothing i've heard today chairman suggests that is the case
thank you
mr williamson is there anything you want to come back on or you feel you've had enough in terms of summing up on matters a and b
yes i was proposing we close for lunch
UNK at two and then go straight into matter c which is the next section
yes thank you er thank you chairman
erm i think probably yes the debate has been probably as extensive as it needs to be
erm i'm not sure whether there's an UNK need to actually bring it all back together again in the context of a summary
i think the county council's made its position fairly clear hopefully particularly clear
i don't think er my only comment would be that having heard all the comments that have been made and listened to them and tried to UNK them and understand them i don't think they really alter er fundamentally our position
thank you
so we'll UNK at two
were you dying to say something mr UNK
UNK ryedale district council
about time i put an opinion i think
erm just three UNK from a district level on matters that have been raised
first of all erm ryedale district isn't saying that the policy is UNK because north yorkshire is in any unusual regardless of the quality of the countryside here but that this is a reasonable reflection of national policy on development in the open countryside
secondly that i think ryedale was under the impression that policy e two wouldn't affect local UNK choice of allocated sites but that it was a policy to apply outside of developing units and those sites we wish to allocate in local plan and not that was going to restrict our choice in our case in those sites
and thirdly with regard to mr UNK concern erm i don't feel that the policy UNK the provision of low cost housing on exception sites er certainly hope it doesn't
erm however if it could be made clear perhaps with an extra paragraph in the explanatory memorandum that i would welcome that
thank you
UNK put
can we come back at two and go straight into matter c major exceptions
i actually wanted to that i didn't really want to go as far as for example deciding that the chair what they are voting would be within the resources available to the
the other area we that we explored in some depth was er whether the library room could be combined to library or to library but we've left it to them to make a decision but they appear to have so decided that there is a mixed pattern emerged
some libraries want their own library group others are quite happy to be joined in with one or more libraries within the adjoining group and the constitution does in fact provide that investment wish what we haven't said what those who should be at maximum membership and to their claim will common sense not to make it too large otherwise it might turn out to be more than sensible discussion among a reasonable amount of people but this but then to decide that equally to encourage them to ah find ways and means of the public other than library users who will be represented on the committee and to that
i vote that this a good point other activities for the county council in a few years that you that you will find er people anxious to support thank you gentlemen
thank you is there a seconder to that
i'll second that
seconded by do you wish to speak now
yes i would mr chairman erm i concur with every word that and confirm that support er mostly er
i've have been given notice that there is one proposed amendment which i intend to call now because then we can vote on the whole thing
no actually
sorry
sorry i saw it yes i beg your pardon i'm sorry
i would like to speak
you wish to speak
sorry right
ladies and gentlemen i would like to move a very small amendment to do a the second a membership on item four on where it says up to three represent the area etcetera erm now the which i am currently a member of includes three libraries erm which are and there are in fact five county councils involved in the area of those three libraries when in fact UNK has its own UNK and there was a but i would like to see
well we should be able to decide before the meeting and make the changes as we go along
yes
yes just how quickly but and the people that are used to the style of how they're gonna be done
i think that's UNK point
quite straight forward
so we probably can get another lot well before the
if we're just talking about the UNK of the way these things are laid out previous set of procedures say things like page one o two page one o three etc and i think that is probably good practice if you can look at a page number and so you know exactly how many pages to expect so we can probably do that when we re issue these procedures as well
okay q UNK
erm if there are any changes however minor if er could we make a point of re issuing the procedure after we've decided a change
yes
sorry i haven't quite statement
if we decide er at each point of the committee meeting i think we should be processing any and suggestion forms that procedure owners have received in a reasonable time in order for them to process it before that meeting
and any changes that we agree in that meeting can we then re issue those procedures immediately after the meeting or as soon as possible after
in principal yes
i the only problem i have
it's not between it's meant to be weeks
yeah
can you just explain how that would work though 'cos we're now erm auditing by job aren't we and given i don't know the audit timetable i can't UNK the effect this would have but it seems that one could be making a change 'cos a particular a job's been audited and it effects q UNK or something one month and therefore you make changes to it and another job's audited the second another month the second month and q UNK needs changing again and it in terms of keeping our staff with us it will be quite UNK i think it's not terribly practical to keep having constant change
right this is one this is one of the things which i am not happy about with the way in which you are running your system at the moment and that is that you're being totally reactive
you're waiting for somebody to audit and find something wrong
if somebody comes up with a suggestion for a change to a procedure at this meeting yes you should be looking at what that suggestion for change is but all of you round the table should be thinking well does that change UNK effect other jobs in our areas and it shouldn't happen that you will get change after change after change
you should be thinking beforehand is this really right or isn't it
at the moment you're UNK you're cor you're UNK your procedures on the basis of auditing and finding out what we're not doing instead of really thinking about them
long term what really
yes but isn't that because we had a very long think about them and this is the first reaction to that long think
they were as good as we could make them we felt and we had a long think
which is first set of audits first set of suggestion forms which have come through because a lot standing order
i think what richard what richard is suggesting is the very sensible way forward in the longer term whether it makes sense right at this instant is another matter
i do think we've got to bear in mind that when you are looking at a change does it apply to everybody
erm like you had the discussion on the first one and said well yes it's all very well for you and yes it's a great idea for you but the rest of us don't want it and i think you've got to do that
i think that so far as we've got
money's our we have the committee meeting we agree changes procedures and as soon as possible we re issue those procedures monthly issues that
but there may be good reasons every now and then for not re issuing er even though it's agreed what the will be
i can't quite think what they are but
i think the other possibility to take UNK point is that if there is a change that's come up because of an audit where a particular job has been audited and you know that within the next week or so another similar job is being audited it may make sense to refer it UNK the next meeting providing you're not UNK it for a long period of time to UNK the results of the two jobs
and that means looking at the audit schedule out front so that you you're not
all that means is a general every month that we'll re issue some procedures
well yes but in the long run that it that won't be it will only be in the short term when we're really UNK out
sorry i meant monthly was an adequate frequency
oh right no more frequently than monthly
right
yes
could we have a copy of the audit time please
have you got one there
yeah
good
let's move on then to q UNK
right
were any of your UNK about q UNK si
yes one of them is
erm start from the beginning
there's the UNK from peter which is pointing out that the letter of confirmation that we reference to because it was a repeat so reasonably enough they're not going through all the assumptions and he also is saying that the er letters of confirmation that is a repeat of the previous job
erm a suggestion from UNK attached
there's a suggestion here from sarah
the application states that this procedure does not cover UNK based on rate cards
we use rate cards in that excess but we still comply with the procedure which
it's perfectly reasonable to follow the procedure book and the procedure
are there any other rate cards that might be excluded
well no there's the t g i rate cards but then this doesn't apply to t g i
but that's on computer
yeah
perhaps there's no need to
'cos the thing about rate cards is that if the rate card is there you don't have to go and get special UNK or you quote them the rate card
well we have the same guidelines as
okay
you wanna remove it
but you don't have a costing you do have a costing quote form
costing quote form
do you have all of these other things
it it's a case of what she's letting herself in for if we strike this out
maybe she's not covered by this in effect
well i mean we have a different costing form but we have costing forms
where else do we have rate cards to rate card printing
yes i'm trying to think
have you got a separate procedure for
yeah
knows the separate procedure
well i'll have the
i'm not to keen on striking it out
if we leave it in sarah can still follow the procedures
it's the same if we take it out if we take heaven knows what
well we just established that there are areas where we're using rate cards and where we don't follow the procedure
i think
does printing follow
printing
printing has its own separate procedure
i think one of the problems is not taking out rate card if you leave out if you actually say this procedure does not cover full estimates and costs or costing based on rate cards
so if you don't take that out it means that effectively you're gonna have to have another procedure somewhere that's going to cover rate cards
and if they get if they're happy to work to that
er we're gonna need
contact cover the procedure
so if we don't take this out we have to do something about
yes
good right
now erm most of this is about er repeat projects rather than new original ones
erm you can read the suggestion there two point three two point four
my only concern is two point four
we're quite clear we have to have provisional guidelines which say with what level of UNK is required to UNK a quotation of the values
do we have a list of authorised UNK that is people who are authorised to give UNK
yes each division has erm
right so when in two point four it says er a copy of the quotation must be signed by an authorised researcher
er someone as authorised in the divisional guidelines yes authorised to checked and authorised according to divisional guidelines
signed by an authorised researcher
that may not be by name john
erm i mean our UNK our erm guideline is by level
by level
i know we still say that is defining levels
okay i just wanted to be clear we weren't finding an additional list of names of people who are authorised to do this
no
'cos it for example in support when it came to the
i don't know how other people are doing the guidelines but by definition the divisional guidelines mustn't say must define who the authorised people are or those
whether they do it by name or by status level or whatever else really doesn't matter
obviously it must define the
right it's just that we had this issue in support of other research a questionnaire and in support key divisions sorry key departments have lists of named individuals who can UNK questionnaires
that's in data processing and
so i'm just thinking that the potential across the company if you look at our system broadly and an auditor says the phrase authorised researcher where's the list of names they'll get an answer in one part of the company and they'll get a list of job titles in another part
no problem
so we agree two point four
erm we haven't let anyone disagree with that either
i'm not clear about the sentence in case a repeat UNK copy of the quotation given to the client must be signed by an authorised researcher
is that
copy of the letter
oh copy of the original letter so if you didn't
no the new letter which says this'll cost the at this time will cost you three thousand five hundred then you've got it signed by an
quotation probably based on your previous jobs somewhere write that down
no you haven't
in case we repeat
no i don't see any reason why we shouldn't arrive at a costing based on the costing quoted before
yeah but you've got to come up with a cost somewhere that's got to be
yeah well yeah you just do that times five percent
percent or whatever
yeah that's what i mean
yes but
that's the figure that appears in the quotation to the client
that's the only place the cost goes
yes
i don't see a need to have it repeated on a separate bit of paper anywhere else
right
just
the only thing is if in access they may never actually write this down
they always write it down
oh they do
UNK
oh right
well that's all right
i mean the difference is i think that if you if the letter comes from the liaison point then the letter won't necessarily be signed by the authorised researcher but we're saying a copy of the letter is signed by the authorised researcher and put in the file
right
yeah
yes
clearly if the person is authorised himself the letter on its own will do it
yeah
UNK in the first sentence needs to be in upper case
in two three
right
okay two three two four and two five are all accepted
yep
well done good
moving on to q UNK
any extras on q UNK before we start
erm guidelines
he's got that here
oh has he
right fine
oh no he's got hang on
none of the new ones
so
yeah right
there were references in the last two meetings and two UNK from liz and peter erm which i can dig out if you want me to
it's erm as you can see it's divisional guidelines for UNK costing needs to be and referred to under related documents rather than just divisional policy
yes
i think this was one of the UNK erm arguing that er a proposal er will help prepare the letter wasn't
a letter to the UNK
i mean it's the same project
no that's okay
erm four nine the research of formal question letter order form or contract to my mind quite honestly a purchase order form is a contract from the client but erm the UNK seemed to think that it wasn't so i don't know whether it's worth changing this depends how the auditors form
the auditors picked up that we had a pink purchase order form which was neither a commissioning letter nor a contract
in my eyes it is a contract but do we need to make this change
as we're going to make other changes anyway so
yep
and we said that where a form referred to a procedure the procedure would refer to the form so i've added that details are completed on the research approval form
yeah
erm
that's details of the
of four point nine
the date of written confirmation from or to client
yeah
we've also got client so we've also the client contact record sheet which is
you don't have a enquiry do you
you only have it once at this point on not at this scene of the
yes it does i think
yes i think it does
now once question i have got on this
as i've i mean divisional guidelines UNK costing i've added to the related documents and i'll produce those because they're a divisional thing
er i've now added the research approval form and it's become a related document here but in the original allocation of forms the responsibility for keeping this up to date was not mine
now are we sticking with the allocation that we had in the past peoples responsibility or when we change them in this sort of way are we UNK them about 'cos i like to know what i am responsible for and what i'm not
yes it decision
presumably the original decision was based on the first time it is now the first time
yes that's correct
who is currently
whoever
jenny i think is it
yes
jenny
both are going to be difficult
it's going if you actually think of about this it is going to be difficult to me to remember to change the responsibility
i would prefer that we accepted that UNK original notes defines the responsibility for forms literally for all the time
so do i
i mean we just we just don't have to keep changing it and talking about it
it does mean it's no longer the case that the that the owner of forms is the person who's first mentioned
no but that was just an easy way of
yep
but we have all and we know what
okay
sorry can i just
it may be me misunderstanding but erm are we therefore saying on this one god which one are we on q p
four
four
where are we adding this bit about research approval form
at the end of four point nine
right so we only do it once we've got the formal so we're not generating a research approval form for unnecessarily
no
right sorry
i thought we're only doing it once it's been commissioned
right okay fine
once it's been commissioned
can i just make one suggestion sorry and that is er in four point nine where you've got your formal commissioning letter er you put down order form or contract
if you take the word form out and just leave it as order then it doesn't matter in what form it comes from the
yes
yes
form or a letter
yes
i mean just going back to your point i mean to me an order form is a contract
if we're going to put something in then let's keep it as general as possible
yes
any other points on q UNK
four point six you've got quotation letter and actually a lot of our quotations are actually UNK
would that
it's what it comes down to is an understanding
if we're talking about outside auditors whether it's a letter a fax or whatever won't make any difference as they won't UNK over things like order forms and stuff
they're looking for a written documents full stop
but internally you need to make sure that your auditors and your and everyone understands the same thing
i think it is fair in that case because we do define a proposal as we've done elsewhere as a
good q UNK done
any
no
good
q UNK
are any of you extras on q UNK
yes
erm oh this is the this is the point that erm had stella UNK up earlier on
the UNK erm was about these interim field reports suggested that no such thing existed interim should be taken out and the rest of it should be
er stella was saying we are going to have interim field reports
that's because i'm going to suggest so we call them interim UNK re interim UNK reports
what
and that'll be a related document
no it won't be a related document because we don't
good
they vary
you can't have a standard one
like job descriptions
they vary and job descriptions with them
so you want them to be called interim UNK reports
yes
make sure
lower case
does this apply to er interim response reports
postal surveys
postal surveys
that wasn't UNK but it's parallel
i've never done one
i don't know
i'm looking at alan
you don't know either presumably
could we say
yeah i think it applies
let's say it applies to postal in exactly the same way
so all i've got to do is UNK them
and you'll need to take on more stella
that when it comes to UNK
right interim UNK report
okay fine yep
yeah
right so it's neither of those related documents
yep
five point ten
five point ten
this was the thing that came up previously about er UNK of a report not being recorded anywhere because of that was a compliment slip which a photocopy wasn't kept and so we erm therefore have to have a note made on the client contact form to say it's gone
this is gonna have to be a general reminder to a general point to all UNK because they won't know that i'm sure
that wasn't the original that was never briefed
no
but if we have to do that
a major new
it is a major new point that if we have to prove we've sent things out then that means
but you make a note of that as part of your
i believe it's quite an important part
well
nothing about training should go on er as training people procedure should go on the notice board shouldn't it
i think maybe with this next issue of procedures we need a separate mode going round which says highlights the key things yeah
highlighting the key points
'cos otherwise everyone
everyone will
the reason for setting aside a through the request as UNK where we're actually going to go through all the procedures highlighting the changes are and why
elizabeth could you just sort of mark that in your minute as something that if we do produce a highlight of changes that is one that we
the first thing which is re a really major change to peoples behaviour
it from the requirements of the standard it does only imply where you haven't got a covering letter or anything like that with it
yeah that's all the time though
'cos all our reports probably go out with compliment slips all our
'cos if you've got copies of the reports and things in the file then that's not a problem
where the problem arose was when there was no record of anything having been sent or what had been sent or anything
well what do you mean if there's a copy of the report in the file
i mean if there's a copy in the information office is that good enough proof that it's gone
well this is up to you to decide what you actually
proof if you need it
this is a not unreasonable thing to have as one of our procedures remind you and ten twenty
no i know
now let's move on to q UNK
i think this is the closest that we'll find
well i'm not quite sure that's what it's called
is it called client contact form
client contact record sheet
sheet
client contact
record sheet
record sheet
it's not a form it's a sheet
is that referred
you take your do you know that
what
advertising campaign you probably don't know
oh yes i do
your sheet
have you changed your sheet
is erm set down as a related document form there or
UNK
not yet no
i was gonna say UNK
so in this case i do inherit a new form do i
no one else has got has someone else got responsibility for client contact record sheet
no i don't think they have
i think i have 'cos i think it's on the erm q p whatever it is document control policy records and i think that's one of mine
oh yes it will be and it's it'll be in the list the list of what should be in the master job file
yep
in the list
yep
it'll be in that
quality records
yeah
client contact record sheet
now i've got a suggestion form from sarah here with four points on it
is this on q UNK
is that on q UNK
it's still on five yep
point one er for access the field element is pre booked it's only necessary to book additional days or shifts verbally in excess of that already reserved
will that come under the erm when they UNK continuous or would it continue as a non standard survey
no UNK has already argued that in most cases access is covered by a standard procedure survey
right
so what if it says simon because i wasn't paying attention
so point one does not apply to access have to have
yep
well let's carry on with there are others here
point two
booking forms are used for access face to face
erm a schedule is used as a telephone UNK all the projects on that particular survey
so there's an appropriate booking form for face to face which is actually in excess
i'd say so
well is it oh no
come on
can the term er appropriate booking form cover this thing called the schedule
oh yes
er oh
call it a booking form
form
yes
i was just saying that's what a booking form is a schedule isn't it
no i mean the others have actually got booking form written on them
are we gonna be changing the name of the schedule to booking form
yes
or booking schedule
or booking sheet
either that or we write a couple of variations on the end of this and we say the general access UNK to this but in their case the other one is pre booked the extras and they have a booking schedule
'cos this says specifically in the applications with the exception of continuous surveys
therefore and i think we'll all take access to something that we would
paul point q does not apply to access by telephone which is what we're for
UNK well we don't particularly want access to UNK from the procedure
no
which if we car if we call it continuous survey then it would be
i've also got points at point three and point six now
this is when erm we need to go back and look at your continuous survey procedure
yes
which we've already talked about and there's no reason why erm you cannot have a one UNK for access
it says it works in accordance with our normal procedures except and rather than put the exceptions for access in that procedure
this requires us going through these with UNK as we've frequently already got access as an exception in them
we had it on this procedure already
it's not complete is it
one point four
and it's coming and from what simon was saying it's coming in other places as well
yes points three and point six
i think very good at going through with a UNK anyway and i'm sure that she could quite adequately
there's a fundamental problem in here that my definition of the continuous survey includes access
if said to me what's a continuous survey i would put access in it
aren't we going to
this procedure says the continuous surveys are excluded and then specifically says erm what applies to access except this one
i think that's the UNK isn't it
the oth the UNK don't say except continuous surveys anyway do they
most of them don't
yeah but we have got a problem with the UNK so far
this is the first where we've got a lot of problems with access
i mean my concern here is that if you've got a procedure that's got nine points in it and effectively we're going to go through one two three five of those nine points and say either this does not apply to access or access does it differently
they're not working in accordance with that procedure
none of this really applies if you read each of these they don't apply to access in the real sense do they
in the full sense that them we're talking about
well five can't apply 'cos four
it sounds to me as though we should let the application stand with the exception of continuous surveys
delete this reference point four does not apply to access by telephone take up UNK point that we need for access when we've got through the other continuous a brief statement which says the project planning procedure doesn't totally apply until
if we leave
project planning
it's not a separate procedure
it's a document available within access
oh i see
it just says it's different
but there's a continuous procedure that says
right so there'll be a statement here or would that be in
there'll be a statement in the procedure that richard is going to write on behalf of jenny
oh right
which defines a list of things which will have their own er statement exceptions
so if we're leaving with the exception of continuous surveys in there where do we say er
i thought we were gonna write
so we're going to write that in
because those
that's gonna be in the individual master job file
they're gonna be in their master job files
any differences
but they all follow this
virtually i think
fine in that case
then they just have somebody who says we follow procedure of q UNK
they don't even need to do that
if they are actually following a standard company procedure the project planning is very good monitoring
yes the continuous procedure only allows you the freedom to make changes if you need to
so if you don't need to
i would suggest that any areas here at as a overall statement where you said things don't apply to continuous that those are actually taken out and that every procedure applies to everything unless it is specifically removed and your continuous one allows you the
yes that is reasonable now we're creating a continuous one isn't it
i mean that was obviously put in here at the time that we didn't have anything that covered it
oh that's right yes
so i think perhaps if you take that out and write this continuous and non standard one it allows you the facility for using it or not using it depending on the project you're working on
presumably should we therefore have something that covers quality oh sorry no this covers it doesn't it yeah o k
richard another point
erm the only reason this is an issue that i get a cooking for as research process manager anyway as audit manager i need to have other booking forms and the only booking forms and additional booking forms i need are all jobs which then got to mrs which are the so i ask please make amendment to put audit manager in and i don't think we need to specify
erm can someone make it clear to me where we ended up with q UNK i am not sure whether we are changing the application or UNK yes the exception both doing both your doing both yes
is this being UNK with the exception or continuous service with the application and we are UNK that point UNK doesn't apply to access
we will have a new procedure called continuous and non standard surveys which says that they will follow the basic procedures except where this doesn't make sense and if it doesn't make sense the job will have in it's master job file a statement of how it does comply with whatever it has to deal with
now on that point for access someone now needs to pick up and write effectively a simple this is how we project planning on access
and there may be one or two other things we work through over this meeting and the next meeting
we are close to the end of erm you should be lively signing this document
we might call it a day at the end of the assignments and take UNK away to UNK erm lets get to the end of the assignments first q UNK
where is q UNK papers UNK this one i think we should give a little thought because this is the one i think where oh yes this is going to get complicated because i have now been given a UNK and a few suggestion forms about it
you said you didn't have the print of it is that right
yeah UNK has given me
UNK still missing two
this is also one where we chase our search approval forms and procedure
we've got quite a lot of these reports together here
it's also the one that covers
you should continue this as a staff meeting with
the only change that i have got here are minor things that were references from a previous meeting all the difficult stuff comes from the UNK and the suggestion forms that i have not looked at yet and so if you want to do that around a table because i don't know whether UNK right
can you
erm i just hoped to dictate to you which would cover the changes of the research approval form
well there is a list of things list of points here UNK does not apply to UNK does not apply to UNK t g i questionnaire
9 research approval forms for relevant to t g i space
UNK does not apply to t g i survey
the UNK so that the UNK search approval form no longer has provision for b p questionnaire approval
continue reading first continue reading
company UNK will not go through data UNK but d p approval is critical why has this been removed from the form
because the only job we haven't UNK is continuous and there are no procedures for continued jobs yet and we have not yet got an ad for kathy job and therefore no procedures were a UNK thing
however
laughing
however as we write these continuous things which we are talking about approval for kathy clearly is an issue permanent restructuring for each
i'd suggested to sarah it might be covered by q UNK which actually says that the research approval form is signed by the researcher which she felt wasn't really enough
that was my understanding of what might be meant to cover that point
that she felt that it was really something d p actually signed off
well there is not for kathy but for kathy she thought this would be
well they keep a record now don't they d p keep a record anyway there is a system where d p keep their own records perhaps it would be helpful they've authorised
if i just read out what i was going to suggest simon described the new system for approvals it goes something like erm sorry it's 9 all approvals are recorded on research approval forms full stop
erm in order to UNK the approvals from support division field approval is recorded on the field review form data preparation and d p approval is recorded on data preparation schedule the name of the person giving approval the name of the person the names of d p's approvals are recorded on the research approval form
so obviously you just write down that rita did it on the UNK
but rita in her own department has got the document that she sends so the researcher doesn't have to take the bit of paper round to everybody and get their research approval form signed
that's fair enough
because you get action
sorry
there's not room on the form i don't think
it doesn't matter cause rita can't d p could UNK it
i said we haven't got a procedure for kathy
i thought you were reading out the bit to
all i have been saying is the things which aren't UNK
everything else questionnaires
now kathy seems to me should be checked checking the UNK just as if it was going over the telephone
well then that's just what i was just trying to think through on kathy
well we don't have procedures for it we haven't written them
sorry if you take UNK as the para now then d p aren't actually the reason d p sent the paper questionnaire is to just double check that all the columns and everything are laid out in the correct way aren't they and then checking it for that reason whereas they are actually doing it on something like kathy themselves so they there isn't the same approval going on
someone's got to check the UNK are right
the does that on a UNK questionnaire
well he does that on every questionnaire but he still has got to get someone to double check it
UNK it's that element of double checking that
but i mean that d p team do a lot of work on the UNK questionnaires which doesn't really seem to be er sort of fully acknowledged at the moment
yes i think that as richard said we need to agree if quality is to continue we have to write some kathy procedures
that UNK certainly
with a timetable to them we are in the best place to do it now cause we're still learning we have only done three jobs four now haven't we erm the kathy procedure is definitely needed
we are UNK to a halt on those aren't we
yeah
we got d p 9 UNK we've still got four to do
are any of those other one simple what you would consider simple ones to understand
erm i will have to look at them
they are actually
as 9 is one that obviously needs a lot of work and a lot of thought on it
i am proposing to delay 9 as a question for the next meeting UNK quality control UNK paper
erm this was the suggestions from rita
all of them seem very sensible to me
well i have accepted adding those research review meeting
yep
are you what are you going to call this form now si is it the qualitative review form or
erm it is an existing
it's called a qualitative data review form no it's called a qualitative research review form so what's this in the something else
oh i see as opposed to that which is how many groups they proceed to check
the qualitative research review form it's existed for sometime
so UNK now reference and there is a project review meeting as there is a quantitative work
you have got four things sorry related documents
four how have i got four
i've qualitative field review forms yeah qualitative data review forms yeah qualitative research approval forms
it does exist but it's not UNK here but it does exist
and if it's not UNK here it may not be UNK anywhere else
well it needs to be q UNK then doesn't it
where we were just now with the research then talk about questionnaires
called research approval forms
no there is a separate one for qualitative and it is different
yes it has a lot it has a lot less on it things like
is this document on that side do you know
what
no i just have qualitative approvals
it's not mentioned anywhere i think it ought to come up first in q UNK doesn't it
well can i make a suggestion that you add it all to the list of the things to discuss it is
UNK
did you get that one simon
erm discussion of q UNK we need to decide when we qualitative approval form or whether it gets business procedure q UNK
in that case we can't UNK this one until we have decided that
so i think that should be bought up
no one owns this form what we are trying to do is make sure it's ready so therefore it has an owner
it seems sensible that it goes with wherever the
the qualitative procedure is aware of your design procedures
they may do a few they're not going to cut there they will cut
yeah but it doesn't really fit in here at all i mean it's nothing to do with any of this
nothing to do with any of this at all
it could come up under
you see my UNK for qualitative are slightly different to the four months at the moment and i feel perhaps could exchange q UNK for the control procedures to be a longer procedure but to have everything covering the project plan in progress monitoring through to quality control procedures for just the quality
so if you look at something like q UNK where you have got this point UNK in fact a lot of the points don't actually apply to UNK because many of the points relate to erm d p erm qualitative field as opposed to survey
so i do just wonder if i couldn't pick out point say 1 and 2 of q UNK and 6 which are about booking and booking forms and UNK the commission of qualitative through to whatever is required during the run off of it and then add the quality control check and finally you have got this the final review
so in other words qualitative the whole of qualitative between commissioning as merit checks has an er
yes o k that a major review of the whole thing though
do you want me to have a go at doing that simon because i have been difficult about it if that helps you
well that would be welcome but it's fine and it should be down to me to do it but you are all welcome
o k i'll try do a version but it does effect on q p UNK an q UNK you see as well coughing
can you and simon
liaise
coughing
do you think that's a good idea
yes i think it is
could i explain one alteration on q UNK simon given our recent changes
we've got this erm er some one is going to monitor a proportion of work that you have recorded as UNK anyway and it will be a research director or a d i'm just wondering whether we can comply with this now
er well will you leave that to me in the re writing of this
sure absolutely
q UNK we are going to move on from then unless there are any other comments on q UNK rita is going to attempt to UNK and draw together material from previous procedures and that means that adjustments of previous procedures you will be able to sign and UNK them
sorry are you saying that erm we are going to delay doing anything about q UNK
i would in that in the light of well actually no we don't have to
in actually physically up UNK anything i would suggest that at this point that simon doesn't do of them until after the next meeting when we have got all the UNK together as well because again they may attach things just that you've got your information and know what's been decided and do the whole lot after the next meeting
can't we get UNK to do the up UNK
i think it would be easier to try and draw them together so that we have got this document with the position so far as we have a lot
it's very hard i am finding it hard to keep up with them at the moment
certainly we shouldn't re issue anything until after the next meeting but erm having the procedures we have finished with so far in their latest form probably helpful even if it's only you whose has the master copy simon right so when we need some reference we have got that chapter and verse
UNK i am sure would be quite happy to
laughing
she will be UNK
she certainly won't be
this is what worries me if you have got too much stuff going through one person that
that's what will confuse her
but their always in version two
no there not this is going to be an interim version between one and two what UNK just suggested
it's still typed as two
i it's she will type it in as two and then you will give her the next draft and then two and then the next draft and then two i mean there's no confusion there for her
that is extremely confusing for her cause she has on her computer she has various versions named in two unless she UNK previous versions of UNK when she does this one well she should she should UNK the correct one which isn't what we did with UNK
well then one is a complete rewrite
but we had various versions of UNK but we didn't ever get rid of the first version so we could the one that UNK did and then the one that i changed and then the one that the committee changed all exist so that we can back track what we actually did
right
how did she with this we just need to type over it no we do i mean you do this just the same as any normal report you do the first one and then you edit it and make yeah
UNK will be alright she UNK what she's doing it's just whether she has the time to do it she would liked it if we had done this before christmas so that while you were away john
you could have done it she had plenty of time to do it
would we be able to do erm just a sort of support ones and d t p if we got the masters from UNK as a standard responsibility
UNK now she's made them out shall we say we will take that one to share the load
if UNK gives a brief one
press on please to q p UNK papers turning
i don't think i've got anything new on this so all of this comes out of b t UNK and this is all to do with UNK original paper about who had responsibility for forms and so on
any problems with these proposals
seem perfectly sensible to me
accepted
right then number UNK q UNK
erm we are UNK some points in that one erm we were trying to avoid it before but i can't seem any way of avoiding it here because these are major new things
then there's the new additions i'm sorry about that
papers turning
the proposals on q p UNK actually reflects erm the decision we made earlier on my proposal about suggestion of whose responsible for
sorry
well i think points 6 to UNK are to the procedure owner who UNK what action and under responsibility both points it's actually procedure only and not divisional quality manager
that would be o k if the only suggestions allowed were suggestions about procedures
we have just agreed that we would allow suggestions about procedures and other suggestions about the way the company is run
they are often the same person or principal it could be either in divisional quality manager or procedure
just a change of how we would suggestion box unless
so maybe simon a brief statement in the application yep would clarify
well
we decided that we didn't need to change the application i suggested that
this procedure describes how suggestions for improvements to systems and procedures are generated
well in that case how about on method point 1 suggestions for improvements we need the word UNK yes suggestions for improvements yes suggested to for improvements to procedures
well i suppose we've got to UNK it anyway so we might as well
yeah
good
i propose elizabeth that you circulate UNK to everyone but we don't know with them that we will read them prior to the next meeting and agree them at the meeting papers turning i have got to assess papers turning take one
take one of those i've taken one take loads of copies three procedures coming out i thought i was getting it already anyway laughing UNK the whole process
can we just agree one final bit of detail before we pack in there are a number of procedures now either which we be re prepared as the basis of today's discussions we have only got two have we is there just two three UNK and UNK i've got UNK is choices it was the first one to come round
don't try to blame me
bottom pile in choices if you can send it back
are there any spares to erm oh yeah thank you
suggestions in preparation for the next meeting for those procedures that we still have to review the procedure owners are going to put the information to us in one of two ways if it is a minor modification procedure small changes of wording things need to be UNK we will UNK the procedure with red line and strike out in the way that jenny procedures have been prepared and circulate before the meeting
yep if the procedure owner thinks that more substantial discussions are needed then we prepare something based on model assignments paper which UNK the erm in put so far making the proposal as a bases
everyone happy with that
just to confirm it is one o'clock next monday working lunch
is there any chance of a bigger UNK room or is it just
whenever possible i try to get a lecture theatre erm but i was told it was booked all day today we were originally in presentation room then came so be grateful we're in the board room
that was actually quite a productive meeting although it took quite a time to get through it i think we did the right thing on the continuous procedures
that will be bit of a break through as i was getting a bit UNK about them
any note from me about progress will follow next month's meeting not today
i agree yep
o k before we pack up any other business
erm there was i am sorry to be boring but there are all these action points from the previous meeting oh yes i forgot the action points do you feel we have covered them
i don't know
erm i don't think we can spend a long time considering them it's just if people bear me UNK through them our brains
could i also ask a question which you might be completely clear on but i'm not when we do back checks on files and make sure they are all up to date and so on we come across maybe a research approval which hasn't been signed off in the right places how far back in time do we need to get that signed off
we don't
we don't
if it's something like that erm all will go back and check that erm the researcher in as a matter of course a couple of months and make sure
but when it comes up for the real audit what job is it going to encourage jobs that are audited
old jobs you can't say don't know they will of course be
we will explain our procedure and how a system is developed to be assigned they will decide
what will happen in fact is that you'll have a start date for your system which was basically when UNK was and what they will be looking for is that everything from that date forward is UNK right so that a job that started before then they won't look for the initial part of that job to comply right as of that date onwards they will look for it to comply
in practice if you are back checking files and such like if you find something that is current word which should comply and you find something that hasn't been appropriately signed or whatever if it's easy to get it done yes do it yes if it's not easy to get it done erm it may be you've got to use your judgement because i don't want you to go into a lot of work but it may make sense to make a final note we are aware that this wasn't done correctly this person has been reminded or
in this case it's fine anyway so
well that depends on whether you are actually doing it during an audit or doing it for other reasons what they are looking for is that your system is getting better and that you have done the right things
well thank you
i will run as quickly as i can through the minutes of the last meeting just raising those things which still have to be UNK
erm missing procedures we have decided that jenny is going to write t g i UNK will write b t and we are going to write something on access and we may need to write something on erm health and finance and those documents we have got in the master file
so that's under way
er costing for parallel repeat jobs that's been dealt with by simon erm client contact record i think that's now been UNK into new procedures yes we have just talked about that er sub contracting you have probably dealt with that although we haven't discussed it yes er list of procedure owners i have prepared and UNK it i don't how wide they have circulated it was meant to go into the quality manual and the quality manual is not being re circulated until march time
i will provide a copy to elizabeth and we will circulate it to members of this committee together with the UNK meeting
UNK definitely got a copy
UNK i think i got a copy but i just sort of filed it with all the quality manual stuff as there were various different things which needed
alan d p forms done
yep
all forms UNK out get things destroyed quality divisional quality managers
i think we've reviewed that this morning early and we are doing quite well on forms but do we need any further action on that
yes we really need to do this don't we
do the UNK yes and sorting which is really going to come from our meeting
well can the divisional quality managers be prepared to report back on this next monday
well wouldn't it be better to wrap it all up in the forms meeting
rather than take the time of the quality committee
what's this forms meeting
it isn't yet
it isn't john hasn't arranged it yet
that's why it's not in my diary
i'll organise that
o k
all of that next bit relates to the form meeting
the UNK meeting and i will take along to that
so that's down to me yep
o k well we have dealt with that research approval is what has changed it
is that all that was
you've done that
laughing
every so often senior level people must go to files to check that things have been correctly you need to continue to do it action divisional quality managers
i'd like elizabeth to bring that forward yep for my benefit as i know i haven't done it and i'd like it as a prompt
you want some spot checks half an hour a week to go and do some spot checks on that
how about that
was that meant to be that people like me should be doing spot checks richard should tell people like me to do spot checks or richard was going to do spot checks
it should be that richard does it though he might choose to delegate it
but the i
richard is responsible for seeing that it is done
yes
yes
in one way or another
there are two things you're trying to achieve
one is the spot checks themselves to make sure that everything is right the other is to show the commitment to people like you that this thing's important
active staff
so we need to make that happen
yeah
t g i UNK well UNK working on that
sub contracting work q UNK
rita
t g i production list
yes to be fair jenny came in er on friday to talk to me about it but i just didn't have time i was rushing off to a meeting so i've
you carried forward that
yeah i couldn't i just didn't have time
er okay we'll carry forward jenny
probably in her procedure
yes
q UNK changes
yep
d t p printing need their quality UNK reference in presentation will of course be
jenny did circulate to me by way of saying i've done something about this copies of d t p quality manual and printing quality control manual
with good quality manual one of quality control manual and all these are is the old procedures quite badly out not written anything like
so really i thought they were a bit of a mess to be honest
is that a manual
that's a manual
big UNK
i don't think they are any good for the purpose myself but maybe you've got an old version of the
the procedure circulated them as the thing that's in place
yeah
they've been UNK and they've been called erm procedures
erm
what
guidelines sorry
guidelines
and er they are actually a good description of what goes on in those departments and those that relate to these procedures
could you make sure that jenny is clearly briefed then because she thinks this is version UNK dated january UNK
there is some confusion there i think and er i'm glad they've been UNK and issued
there's already more reason why and that's suggesting that you're saying january is inadequate
you can have two issued in january one is like UNK and one's UNK because you know that UNK is more reason for
so we're going to follow up on that
well the issues of it
alan can you feed back to jenny what the state of play is but she also doesn't seem to have her document control particularly well organised and if you and d p sorry d t p re issuing those guidelines you shouldn't be
jenny should be
if they are related documents to the procedures
they're controlled documents
erm they weren't controlled documents up until now
they weren't okay
they're about to become
they came out of the audit didn't it
and out of UNK audit
yes they sort of UNK out of the woodwork
thank you stella
we just raised an instance of the next point of the minute
it must have been reference for jenny to be
no
they were originally procedures you see and then they disappeared as procedures and went nowhere
they were in they're coming in seven reports
your suggestions
like the last meeting yes
it's not fair
can we use things like document
as things are revised we should try to UNK names of third level documents
we've got the department quality UNK working guideline we've got the quality control manual we've got the quality manual erm it would be nice to see if we could UNK them
but we could only do that from procedure levels and
that was a wasn't it
but not accurate enough to say at this stage
it there's no point in re issuing perfectly good documents just to change the name on them
no
but
but new documents that are being prepared
i would suggest you need a standard name for it
quality guidelines or just guidelines
guidelines
wouldn't it be whatever it is yes
guidelines
dot
dot guidelines
well can everyone take on board the idea now if there are new documents being prepared or we get to a major re issue
we're talking about guidelines
yeah in the process of
even if they're all about quality control
yeah
no just thinking of data UNK
think about guidelines
yeah i mean a document that is literally about levels of UNK and
i have one question about it though and that is ar if you're calling them guidelines are they guidelines or are they mandatory
we could use this procedure say according to the guidelines then it becomes mandatory
guidelines
no it becomes mandatory to follow the guidelines which are not mandatory
i think it's important that you know
they are in the sense that i think we believe they're mandatory don't we
but we don't want to make it a potential area to fail
it depends on just what these things are for because if think about a third level document as being something like the t g i manual that's got to be mandatory you've got no choice in it because it's not covered in procedures it's got to be that
there are other things that may not be so you need to think very carefully about what name you're going to call them and whether all these documents are mandatory or are advisory
could we put on the agenda for a future meeting something called review of guidelines where the this is exactly the issue
yeah so what to call them if we're going to change the name or what we will eventually change it to we're not going to change them now and whether they're mandatory or not and whether we need to change them to say that
for a future meeting or the next meeting
not the next meeting
just
no not the next meeting
february march
february is good
february
training records there is a committee in place meeting tomorrow to deal with that
sorry february i think we'll be having feedback won't we
don't worry about it we'll
alright
february will be good we should it before march
we should no the answer to this before comes
right
er stella have you taken action on q UNK
erm yes we have
this is where we've come up with critical application software
okay
i mean you'll see it in my procedures when we when we get
see we've twice as divisional quality manager half an hour each week looking at
it's now an hour
did i say an hour
oh is it
double dose
erm richard to organise our auditors to UNK caroline next time
okay
yep fine
er divisional quality manager should give positive feedback on divisions about this pre assessment the one that happened
anything to report back on that divisional quality managers
one divisional quality manager didn't even get positive feedback
i think richard gave me a copy of all
mine they haven't
no i mean the meeting wasn't that long ago
i'm having a division meeting on
so i'll make sure that it's more general i mean i talk to the directors
i'll not call a formal divisional meeting we had that on wednesday
well i went round and talked to group but i think there's a lot of er about keeping everything fine and up to date at all times in all places and all the rest
it was almost the energy to manage to do it a hundred percent of the time and a hundred percent of the occasions that they felt i think was a little UNK
there is still lots of UNK and i'm sure er they'll aim to do it but
we're getting if we could be this time next week given feedback and come back with some response and maybe john you can take whatever comes out of that on board in your
er changing needs to get signatures that is done
thank you very much for your help UNK
er john went around to all staff is done
done that
well actually wasn't a reminder about the need for suggestions so perhaps that could be included in the next one
i included quite clearly in my re issue of the research approvals form er the covering letter that went with it saying you know here's an example of suggestion that makes your life easier please keep them coming
that didn't go to everybody
that only went to the
it went to all procedure holders
only the nine
call for more suggestions okay
mid january we're working on that suggestion forms three quality UNK i've put that in the revised list of people coming round in these minutes
q UNK suggestions
well we've done that haven't we simon
yeah i think so
matters arising from previous meetings
version UNK related documents task not yet complete
still not complete but we have reviewed that and we're making good progress
mind if i have something with it
roy is to check on receiving inspection of testing received in
q UNK is amended now simon
q UNK jenny has drafted and circulated
q UNK amendment still to be done
you've done those simon
yes
and issued them to date that's fine
b m r b international reports not yet issued
yes it is
yeah a manual
that jenny has designed
jenny t don't know 'cos it was down to jenny d to
jenny has given me notes on one issue here which i must admit i haven't had a chance to read yet and it's about house style about both manual
i'll make sure that er i've read that and talked to jenny in time for the next meeting so we know where we stand
so that's a cross to bring that one forward please
john still
and
well she knows she's going to do them
good
quality jobs isn't her favourite job
is it anybody's favourite job
she does it well though
er next for job descriptions to go to the quality manual
i'm sure you've got the masters in place haven't you elizabeth procedure review to start in september UNK in appropriate er richard
yeah
good
dates for UNK meeting blah
next trial audit that's it
what an awful that did get ticked off actually as we went through
well done
sorry it was another long hard meeting but we are making good progress and i think by the end of our next one when we've revised most of the procedures we'll be well placed
good thank you very much
need to see where you've got to and
well the software came off the tape without any problems wha whatsoever
good
and i copied it over it all compiled first time
e even the UNK
even the UNK
that's interesting cos i mean it is a sort of a UNK
luckily we have the er UNK for that
we have that particular UNK that was
yeah
good then
yeah
i thought you might in fact but i mean when it was first taken we first looked at the tape people in there weren't sure so oh that's good news oh that helps a lot because they've tried the original UNK was developed on UNK v m s
right
so that's why you see a lot of talk about UNK v m s around UNK and funny things like that which are
yeah
which are sort of er e well a UNK is a very crude inter process communication technique used on UNK
but i mean i don't think you need to worry about that cos i think got round that when they when they converted up to
should be okay
yeah so that all compiled up so what some bits don't work
erm there we there was a problem with the erm UNK
right
that just core dumped
but i was able to transfer it onto a separate system and compile that and produce the UNK there
so why did that core dump on
i have no idea
i look looked through it couldn't actually see anything obviously wrong with it
i compiled it onto another system which has far better de UNK tools and
yeah
it didn't core dump
but that sudden
well
UNK
oh you did one on the h p
which one was the one that worked
the one on the h p
the h p worked better
yeah
right
but it doesn't wor do it doesn't so it works on the h p but not on the sun is that right
yeah
so i created the UNK
right okay
on the h the h p and copied that back
yeah sure
and the first stage which is the for UNK stage
mhm
works
right
as far as i can tell the other stages also seem to work
right
but there is a problem with the second stage which UNK the
right
UNK input
right
er into parts of parts of speech
mhm
if i tried to give it more than one word at a time it falls over and core UNK
right
with one word it's unable to determine what part of speech it is
this is not unreasonable
yeah
yeah
and i've been through er th the UNK tools
UNK on the main system
yeah
and slowly up UNK struggle to actually
have you managed to locate it at al not been able to locate where it actually
erm
i've been able to trace back it's probably in a procedure called fetch page
that seemed to be causing
well is that UNK i mean is that a is that the routine that's picking information back from the UNK or something
yeah
right
i was wondering i mean there may possibly be differences between i mean there was the format that speech generate of the h p and the format that the sun would use
mm
er now i would think that the UNK itself is just a w a UNK great look up table yes
yeah
right
er i would check things like signed and UNK bytes
that's the that is the first problem you might find
have you checked that at all
so you might find that if you do a thing on the h p you may find that what is being what's happening is that it it's creating the wrong size UNK in the look up table because either it's using you know er signed and it's su assuming UNK or something
so you've got the data ranges incorrect that sort of thing
right
er you want to check that specification
that's quite likely where it's going to be going wrong
right
that i i've seen that before between erm UNK systems and UNK graphics systems
i also i mean sun to UNK graphics sometimes you need to make s see what the UNK option is in fact
you may find the default UNK option for the h p is different to the default UNK option to handle signed and UNK or signed and UNK bytes may be different
it may well be the case
er now these are you know is the UNK a UNK module or a c module
it's a c module
c right so i would i would almost would think
right
it's a sign problem in that it's not doing the look up properly
these things are UNK to sort out i know
erm w i mean where they don't work when somebody offers code and they don't work there's not a lot you can do other than sort of make some informed UNK as to what might be going wrong
because at the end of the day i mean they're building up a set of rules
practically you've got like a rule UNK
i mean the later stages of the system had things like rule UNK and quite complex things which allowed you a more dynamic interaction with the system so you could actually build rules in and then some rules then erm allowed you to shall we say UNK out certain parts of speech
you found sometimes that other rules weren't required because that rule new rule that you'd finally developed UNK other classes of events
you know so the idea was having a rule UNK system which so you could actively UNK it
you know the rules got more complex but in but in terms of actual processing power the amount of look up required went down
one of the reasons for big look up tables is that the UNK system
eventually the whole lot would be blown into UNK
in a box
well in fact it was
and still can ma buy cards for a p c
but i'm not sure whether that would be in of interest at all to ian anyway
that might
yes you can actually buy a card for a p c and all you do is you feed it erm text and it'll speak it
yeah
albeit in an american voice
is erm ian definitely wants new UNK
yes i know
being targeted at students
yeah i mean the would be very nice if you could get it to go cos it is it is quite acceptable speech
albeit american
american english
which is different of course
so you don't get dog you get dog
d a w g
er but i think people can live with that understand sort of UNK now
erm that that's i think the main thing you want to look at there
right
er what about the UNK stage do you know whether that works or not
does it generate UNK
it's been a bit well it's been a bit difficult to test because with the sort of ready the read me files
very minimal so i haven't noticed
were there any erm already er sort of the intermediate files
things like er erm s UNK files
nothing
parameter file
er just wondering whether
there is UNK apparently book books details of course it's out at the moment
mm
i could search round for papers on it
there's not there's not a lot on because n well i mean w the reason why there's not a huge amount published is because er UNK bought the rights to UNK
right
for something like six million dollars
and so at that point nothing very much was published
no not in the public UNK anyway
i mean there are plenty of internal reports at m i t and at UNK but you certainly can't get them
i have seen a paper been involved with m i t themselves
er do you know what the er what a the input file would look like to the UNK phase
it gives a very UNK idea in the read me files however it also
do you know how many control parameters there are for instance
is it the twenty one or is it the sixty or forty eight
without looking through the source file i wouldn't be able to tell
because erm i do have a variation er a version of the that particular UNK which is a class seventy nine UNK
and i may well have some input files which you could u test with
you need to find out though what version that is
it may well be well the one that was out in the public in the public UNK
one that was published in the journal the american society for UNK research
j a s a j a s a
j s
j a s a journal of the american UNK society
journal of the american society for UNK something like that anyway
that the original class seventy nine UNK was published the source code
and it was originally in UNK source so i don't know whether is it still in UNK source
erm no it's UNK now
is it UNK source now
yeah n what you need to do is if you can look up the what the input parameters h how many input parameters there are and if there are if it's basically a batch of twenty one parameters er i can probably i've probably got the source code for them
er i mean the input files
it depends whether they're UNK input or whether they're binary input format
i would put money on them being what are called k p r
yeah
er k p r format which is parameter file
er p r for parameter
parameter file and that is actually effectively a sixteen bit UNK file
and in fact i can probably get you some of those as well
right
okay
er we moved over to using UNK so that we could actually hand edit them and look at them
but this is about four or five years ago so i mean it's n we've moved on a lot since then
but certainly we can probably find some stuff for er to help test
but did you get er but does the pipeline build for instance
i mean there's a program that builds the pipeline
yeah
and that all builds
right well that's wonderful i mean that's really good news really
mm
mm
you see cos a again it was probably in the early days running on p d p UNK
right
right so you've got to think p d p eleven because it's fairly old stuff now
and i mean UNK in those d in the early days was p d p eleven based
and then it moved over to sort of UNK as well
er but i think could be could be the UNK
cos it's using b er b s d isn't it or j s d stuff so
could be could well could have been UNK but still there'd still be eleven stuff around i would have thought
er you'd probably find that in the p d p eleven around the place
and if it is then they're probably sixteen bit UNK files for the UNK phase
the other thing is that the output frequency is likely to be eight UNK or ten UNK
er you need to think about that
but again depending on your hardware you may the output phase hardware you might need to alter some things in the UNK to change it to the from eight to ten to twelve to sixteen bit data
again i modified the seventy nine and UNK the seventy nine i've had also the later version of the UNK to handle different bit width so it's not a problem
and i know how to do that
there's not a lot about to change
you know you tend to find there are a couple of fiddle factors around actually
and magic numbers like multiplying the width of the UNK by sixteen point o two five or something
you m is it really well is it very well commented at all
it's fairly well commented
yeah cos i think you'll find there are various comments like you know let's say you know move the data into the highest UNK er the most significant bits of the word and this sort of stuff
you know where they and they just multiplying by number rather than doing bit shifts
so i mean you'll find i mean it's not that bad
right i well if you can't get the UNK going it's got a problem of course
if it was on a p d p eleven then the addressing would only be a matter of si sixteen bit as well
in the tables
so again you might find that you're generating the wrong type of UNK number
i mean between your two machines
and also possibly with what it puts as a co was it expect you know have a read of the code
yeah
a little bit more of the code just to find out you know what size UNK it's using
and i think that's probably where your pro the problems would be
mm yes
mm sure
that sounds likely
you know i've seen those sorts of problems before
trying to think what else there is
er that's about what there is well there's nothing to look at
at this stage anyway then we need to have a another think
a little bit of detective work i think to try and find out
i mean you could even write some fairly simple test programs in fact
mm
that do a little bit of you know very simple table look up
or build a table
does the l does the UNK generate you the c source code
like a c look up table
or does it generate a file
it UNK a large well
a large c large c structure
or a just a large table or a large UNK
erm g erm it just gen UNK a large
you see cos i know that some of the phases you find that does it UNK you see cos some of the programs generate programs
in the in the later versions certainly
but you know you generate some of the c source or UNK source which you then compile
no i assume that your file is not one of those
no
no okay
s yeah i wo i would basically put money on it being a problem with the addressing
and it's gonna be either what a short it is or what a
yeah i if there's anything else you want to know i mean i think that's quite a good start
erm yeah i'll er
one of those problems anyway
i'll go through that
i would think i can't really see it being much else i mean it UNK up
that's what it's most likely to be i think
okay
if there's anything else you want to know
i'm generally around so you know
give me a shout
don't lose your bit of paper
okay
yeah that's fine
thank you very much
it's no problem
so you're doing trade at the moment in er agricultural economics i think bob has asked you to prepare some data on er wheat and cotton trade
before we come on to look at that can somebody tell me what's happened to world trade say in the last century what are the major trends in world trade
right o k yeah that's the first thing to note yeah world trade has increased dramatically any other features what's happened to the composition of world trade
manufacturers has had an increase trade
right o k yeah that's the other major erm feature is that UNK share of world trade has declined and manufacturing er share of world trade has increased and i've got some er some numbers here erm so it says before the first world war UNK share of world trade was over fifty percent today it is less than fourteen percent okay so UNK share in world trade is declining and has been declining er essentially over the last sort of seventy years or so
right okay any other features about world trade it's been growing in volume er composition has changed anything else how about the prices of agricultural goods are there any characteristics
as quickly as the manufacture of goods
right okay yeah the UNK there in actual fact they're UNK yep you you're correct in that they may well have risen right over that period erm but relative to manufacturing prices they have fallen erm let's just see if there might be some data in there er erm i thought i had some
i thought i had some information here on prices i can't seem to find it no can't find it never mind i've got some figures here that looks at erm the growth in trade er it's quoting it says between nineteen eighty and nineteen eighty nine the volume of agricultural trade grew by twenty six percent alright however that was that represented one third of the growth in manufacturers so agricultural trade is rising but it's rising much less rapidly than manufacturers here are the prices at the same time so between nineteen eighty and nineteen eighty nine er food export prices fell the prices actually fell from eleven percent t by eleven percent whereas the unit value of manufactured exports so essentially the prices of manufactured exports rose on average by twenty percent okay so over the over that period agricultural prices were actually falling in real terms but if we widen erm s the window that we're looking at erm agricultural prices probably haven't fallen er say over the post war period or if we er go back to the beginning of the century agricultural prices probably haven't fallen erm but relative to manufacturing they certainly have okay
so what can account for er this changing composition of trade
why for example are as manufactured trade increasing in importance
can this be just because er incomes have risen
tt right yeah incomes have risen throughout the world and that impacts both on the demand for agricultural products and also the demand for manufactured products but what do we know about demand elasticities for those two products income elasticities what's the income elasticity of manufactured goods
greater than one less than one
yeah that's right income UNK manufactured goods as a result manufactured erm sectors will be growth sectors simply UNK because as income per capita rises people spend UNK more of their increased income on manufactured goods and as a result we witness a marked increase in trade in manufactures
we would only need to witness a marked increase in trade and there will certainly be an increase in demand why do you think trade has increased and trade isn't a necessary condition it's just that trade has tended to grow at the same time as erm as demand is growing
why might trade be growing
because of transport
okay yeah better transport technology a hundred and fifty years ago it was impossible t erm to transport meat across the atlantic it's er very straightforward now so the UNK of different types of er transport technology and improved transport technology erm has made tr UNK trade okay
any other reasons
the increase in trade in manufactured goods has taken a particular form of trade
there was
intra industry trade yeah good so what is intra industry trade
yep its as yeah the UNK import and export of a similar good or the good of as of the same industry
right so we could think of erm cars for example erm you know we both export cars and import cars
okay why do you think that intra industry trade has risen say over the last fifty years
then why aren't we self sufficient in car production
people want more choice unclear
right
that's right
as people get UNK right one of the they not only demand more goods but they demand a wider variety of what is essentially or what can be classified as the same good
clearly a UNK is UNK different from a jaguar right but as far as er UNK trade goes they'll both go under UNK right okay
one of the main reasons why intra industry trade has risen right is not only that consumers want to purchase different varieties and different qualities of the same good erm that it it's very easy to differentiate the product in manufactured goods right
we've only got to put a go faster UNK on a UNK and UNK change the wheels and we've got a different product we've got a UNK yes we've got a fast skip as opposed to a slow one alright
so because we can differentiate manufactured products very easily and because consumers want differentiated products alright get increase in demand for manufactured goods right
the reason why trade has risen one reason is because erm transport costs have declined in real terms and secondly w why can you think of anything else that may have increased trade in UNK manufactured goods
better technology in production
mm
okay so what are you er hitting on about there adrian
better use of machinery and tractor and erm farmers are at risk of i know that manufacturers who could have to progress these capital to get better returns
that's right i mean we we've got decreasing erm oh sorry increasing returns to stay off decreasing costs
right now with manufacturing er in manufacturing there are economies of scale huge economies of scale this is why we find look at cars again that UNK plant in derby produces all the UNK or whatever for the whole world it's not just for the u k market alright
so cars produced in derby are UNK back to japan right cos all the all the er production of that one car is focused in one plant why is that the case
it's because there are economies of scale alright now if there are gains to be had from UNK right and consumers want UNK products and the best thing to do is to erm focus production in a single location right for lots of different UNK of this product right
so we see massive car plants right
why are they so large because their economies of scale to be UNK right companies are trying to erm to accrue those economies of scale right cos if they don't they'll go out of business because their competitors alright will produce erm a superior or a lower price product okay
so that's been very important economies of scale are very important in the erm the growth of manufacturing trade which is essentially an increase in intra in intra industry trade as opposed to inter industry trade which is erm the UNK import and export of er products from different industries like produce capital goods so cars and in return you will import erm food products but the majority of the increase in world trade has come from this intra industry variety
can i just turn over let's look at th the other side of that coin right because it has all the explanations er as to why agriculture agricultural trade has declined in relative terms right
let's just think about well first of all the incoming elasticity argument right manufactures greater than one agriculture less than one right that's one reason why agriculture is a declining sector right it's also a declining sector in world trade for the same reason that it has got a low income elasticity whereas manufacturing had a high income elasticity now consumers like variety in food just as much as they like variety in manufactured goods alright but what's the problem with agricultural goods they're essentially UNK alright wheat is wheat sugar is sugar
now although we can differentiate the products er agricultural products we can only do that at the very final stage in processing by and large where there's much less scope after product differentiation right at the er the raw material erm level which is where most agricultural trade continues er most trade in agricultural products is in the raw UNK not the UNK the UNK there might be the processing and the manufacturing tend to occur in the country of consumption and not in the country of production a number of complicated erm political reasons erm alright but the but because there isn't the scope for product differentiation alright we haven't witnessed an increase in intra industry trade in agricultural goods whereas we have done for manufactured goods because there is scope for intra industry trade er yeah scope for product differentiation
okay what about economies of scale
are there economies of scale in agriculture
are they in to the same extent or lesser extent than manufacturing
experience the optimistic small
that's right i mean why di why have we got the structure of agriculture as we have you know why do we still have an UNK industry right it's not just a UNK of nature there are economic laws erm and opinion that s that structure the industry and it's because you just don't get economies of scale staying in agriculture
if you did get economies of scale then we wouldn't see small erm small independent producers right we we'd see a an increase in the concentration of the industry like we have witnessed in virtually every other sector
not like the population grows faster than the food so
mhm
the population would demand more manufactures because food can't keep up
say that again UNK
UNK said that food production cannot keep up with the population increase
right mhm
and so the population increase would they wouldn't be able to
that's right that's what you said in you saying that populations were going growing UNK agricultural production was going UNK as a result a population crash is inevitable alright but we know that isn't true right because what when UNK was writing erm UNK was writing just before in the agricultural revolution in the u k so agricultural technology hadn't improved very much in sort of five hundred years right but in the next hundred years agricultural production erm or productivity grows far faster than erm than population
UNK didn't actually UNK this erm this leap in from technology and as a result he was UNK his predictions on past trends so if past trends had continued would have been he w he would been correct but because erm UNK started to erm use technology and at that time it was a very sort of low technology but nevertheless it would would've production dramatically you know you don't think of drainage as being particularly high tech but it can increase the yield on a crop sort of four or five times and so si simple drainage systems would be introduced erm ro UNK were being introduced again UNK you think of being fairly straightforward but erm prior to the agricultural revolution UNK weren't used UNK can improve the UNK of the soil and er yields as well right okay so agriculture produces a UNK product by and large and er as there isn't the scope the product differentiation and there isn't the scope for UNK because we'd need a farm the size of europe to feed the world with w with wheat
now clearly it makes no sense you might be up to producing the UNK in a three hundred acre plant erm near derby right but we can't employ the same techniques in production er when we're making agricultural why not well essentially we're using land we're using land UNK alright and there comes a point when erm you reach dis economies of scale and start er UNK dis economies of scale in agricultural production and that scale of plant is very small but after about well it depends what type of production er what type of product you're making but you know there aren't many farms over five thousand hectares now five thousand hectares is a huge farm it's massive alright but it still only produces a fraction of say u k output cos there's several million hectares of erm but the reason why you don't see these very large farms is that you just don't UNK the economies of scale alright because essentially we need land erm and you're farm gets so big that it would take you half the day to drive your combine UNK over to the other side of th your farm just to erm to harvest the wheat right
hasn't there been a move into much larger farms now
oh yes there ha i mean there are economies of scale in agriculture it's just that they're the scope of them er is less than er the scope in manufacturing so i mean farms used to be a lot smaller and throughout this century this last century we've witnessed an increase in farm size alright but the i think the UNK the UNK farm size is erm i think it's about three hundred hectares okay er erm with three hundred hectares you'll produce a pretty UNK proportion of erm total output but farms used to be sort of one two three ten hectares in size as we've gone through the farms have amalgamated and increased in size and that's primarily due to economies of scale but there are a great deal of economies to be reached once you've got a combine UNK once you've got big machinery alright
you can't really improve your productivity much beyond that
so if you just look at this the arguments for er manufactured or the increase in manufacturing er trade alright are exactly the opposite to erm that explain the decrease in erm the relative decrease in agricultural trade okay
any other one other factor that might be important in er explaining this relative change composition of trade between agriculture and manufacturing something that's in the news at the moment
mm yes get us at a much more er effective role in reducing UNK on manufactured goods than it has on agricultural goods and it's only in this last round of g a t talks the UNK round that agriculture has been brought into the frame alright
prior to erm UNK round negotiations agriculture was always excluded from the negotiations right whereas manufactured goods have been in there from the start and as a result we've seen a reduction in UNK right on manufactured goods that's not to say that erm protectionism on manufactured goods has fallen it has in certain cases but not in all cases
what's happened is that policy makers UNK shifted the emphasis instead of protecting UNK they're protected using long UNK barriers right which are a lot more invisible to er to g a t don't come under erm g a t regulations what those UNK do nevertheless UNK have come down in manufactured goods right erm since the second world war when g a t was er was established
but because agriculture hasn't been in g a t or up until recently hasn't been in g a t agricultural protectionism has grown throughout that period right
why might protectionism UNK trade
increases confidence
okay wh what do you mean there helen
erm
okay so that will UNK consumption essentially
that's right this is the this is the effect
whether ther there's a there's a t two UNK effect the first of which is that high UNK consumption because prices are higher and therefore consumption will fall and secondly if high prices are also charged farmers to domestic farmers right then they'll increase their output
now if they increase their output alright that will UNK alright so protectionism leads to self sufficiency and by and large self sufficiency is UNK that's why it's there right it's to increase domestic output of this particular product
does anybody know why agriculture wasn't in erm the g a t it's never t discussed in the g a t why it hasn't er included in like manufacturing is reason why that is
too political
yes you're right
what do you what do you mean by that adrian
that's right it's a UNK politically sensitive erm er sort of industry right not only is there the element of strategic there's a strategic dimension right which political importance right erm and also er s an electoral specifically electoral dimension
there's also this thing which is called agricultural UNK right and the most developing c most developed countries most of the population live in urban areas and the they see erm er rural areas as being sort of the UNK of society sort of the salt of the earth type of element in society that although they don't participate in themselves would like to maintain right and so even consumers may well be would not want see erm agriculture UNK from er from their country right because they like the products that erm that agriculture produces and they think that you can of erm destroying of the agricultural industry would pose an unacceptable burden on the fabric of rural society and as a result are quite happy to see protectionism er fo for that industry
now whether that's true or not i don't know
i think erm the tide is changing to a certain degree er on that point but agricultural UNK as it's called erm tt is quite an important er aspect is political erm is political motivation for a support or for protectionism okay
erm right so because trade in er trade in agricultural goods has fallen one of the reason for that is because there's been a lot protectionism on er agricultural goods the other side of that coin is that protectionism in manufactured goods has fallen okay
right why should we be bothered about protectionism y'know why is g a t so important presumably there must be UNK as well as losers from protectionism so the UNK and the losers domestic farmers UNK or losers
UNK
good they're the UNK
domestic consumers right losers okay tax payers
losers
yep losers
sorry
yeah it depends yeah it depends wh what type of system of support you actually employ er some systems of support burden tax payers other him er
the general say the tax payers er also lost erm third country UNK
losers
yep they're losers big losers erm third country UNK
no they they'll probably benefit in actual fact right there are som there are third countries don't all suffer right UNK third country you will suffer but if you're an UNK third country you will benefit right
now agricultural erm one of the reasons why agriculture hasn't been included in the g a t is because governments right from all sorts of countries have said hands up why agricultural policy this is a domestic policy it's got nothing to do with international trade right there's no international dimension to it right you can't come in here and t tell us that we're erm UNK these UNK measures right
it's a domestic policy hands off right and this was one of the arguments one of those UNK arguments that they've used in the last forty years right but it's incredibly naive because any domestic policy will have an international dimension i remember the about european community right but it wasn't for the operation of the common agricultural policy countries in the european community would be net UNK of agricultural goods as we were ten years ago UNK because er of protectionism we've now increased our self sufficiency to the point where were a net UNK of agricultural goods what implications has th does that have for international trade
well if we're producing more of our own goods we are UNK less of somebody UNK alright and if we actually become a net UNK then we've erm closing down the markets of third country UNK right so not only do we er consume less of er new UNK lamb than we might do otherwise right
because we're er a net UNK of lamb we're also u erm try enter into the markets where new UNK is er is UNK to australia alright
so domestic policies will always have an international dimension to them alright there are a large number of beneficiaries and losers erm to this policy er to protectionism alright
now just to give you some numbers erm on er who gains and who loses right erm right for the world as a whole right erm the study conducted by right nineteen eighty nine i looked at the cost of some benefits from agricultural support alright in nineteen eighty six to nineteen eighty seven in just one year one crop year alright
now it says on average for and then essentially we looked at the three main support of erm UNK powers like the e c u s a and japan right and they said that on average alright for every one dollar benefit alright for every one dollar benefit one agricultural support right it actually costs right one fifty dollars of the general statistics in order to give a pounds worth of support to domestic farmers we er have to find one pounds fifty right
with any protectionism right when you when you when you protect something that you're doing you're erm you're introducing a UNK a UNK in the system which leads to a UNK of resources alright
that is effectively we're paying this extra fifty pence right resource UNK we there is always what's called a dead weight loss right to intervention right it's an UNK loss or an efficiency loss due to the fact that we're asking t in this case farmers right to using use resources but farmers aren't the most efficient people in resources but in to erm high tech computer companies alright and if we gave pounds worth of support to a high tech computer company they would be able to produce more value as a result of that pound er than if we gave one pound to a farmer simply because erm that sort of the high tech industries are more productive they're more efficient
agriculture isn't particularly efficient economic sense technically efficient but not efficient
right so let's just get back to some numbers erm looking at the european community right the UNK benefits alright the european community common agricultural policy produces benefits thirty three point three billion dollars presumably yes billion dollars
thirty three billion dollars of support goes to erm er european farmers right
consumers a thirty two point six billion dollars right this is every year this is nineteen eighty six eighty seven right
so consumers foot the bill right to the extent of thirty two point six billion dollars
yeah into consumers in terms of higher product prices
right
why consumers pay er in the european community it's because we paying them two or three times more for our food than we would do if we purchased it on the world market erm
however tax payers are also involved right
net cost to tax payers is fifteen point six billion right
although we do erm get some UNK from er import UNK as agriculture is increased its production and we've become more self sufficient right we're UNK less right so we get smaller and smaller UNK right and tax payers pay erm y'know your v a t for example where do you think your v a t's going
seventy per cent of it is going into farmer's pockets right even on goods like m manufactured goods we pay v a t on er manufactured goods and that v a t pays for our contribution to the european community and most of that contribution about seventy per cent of it goes to farmers tt erm right so the next economic costs to european community right are fourteen point nine billion alright that's the size of the dead weight loss that's the UNK right of agricultural support right losing fifteen billion dollars a year right just going down the er the UNK okay just a couple of point just before we er before we close
what effect does agricultural support have on world prices
does it increase world prices
reduce world prices
make them more stable or more UNK
well t in general i mean there are some types of support er more susceptible to but in general
reduces
yeah it reduces world prices why does it do that
erm it allows domestic farmers to produce their so they go on to the world market and they've got everybody else these things
that's right
that's right you know we as consumers hav consuming more of our own products more of our own agricultural products therefore we're UNK less right
as a result supply is increasing right in the face of re falling demand right demand falling off because prices have are high
simple supply and demand right now but this is the demand who say european community as is the supply term erm what we call excess demand occurred rest of the world
are we slap a tax on UNK on there that reduces consumption right what with world prices world prices they used to be here they're now down here alright
UNK essentially supply we we've got over s over supply and that brings down agricultural prices erm and so wor world prices tend to be a lot lower than they would have been in the absence of support
now just to give you some figures i mean same UNK that's the world price supplied the rest of the world in fact the UNK on it show them that the operation of a UNK can affect erm world prices and just to give you some idea erm ah can we just you know when we were talking about the net economic costs well they're within the european community those costs
we can add also to the fact that fifteen billion dollars a year right is lost by er third country UNK alright so we still add another fifteen on there per year that is erm UNK oh yes same study again erm suggest that in nineteen eighty six eighty seven the year they look looking at over forty percent right of support to u s farmers forty percent nearly half of all support to u s farmers quote merely offset the losses created by policies of other UNK countries alright so nearly half of the support given to farmers in the u s alright we t to get them to stand still in er in UNK terms right
because the european community have been heavily UNK its farmers right they were having in order farmers were too successful we've had wine UNK we had erm er butter mountains we had to get rid of that was UNK on the world market as a result of that world market prices would come down right and that UNK the agricultural government sorry the er american government to support its agriculture right and these chaps estimate that nearly half of the support given to the u s farmers merely offset their losses caused by essentially european community and japan UNK their farmers
prices are also made a lot more UNK right simply because the world market becomes a residual market instead of everybody buying and selling through the world market right if virtually everybody becomes self sufficient the world market becomes a bit of a UNK right there isn't such a thing as a world market in that in that particular case it may just be a few very small countries trade on the world market it becomes very small market and therefore UNK to supply erm UNK in any one country and as we know supply UNK on UNK demand causes price UNK
so prices have tend to have fallen on world markets for agricultural goods because of support right and they've also become a lot more UNK and that and that is the er the source of the international frustration with erm the common agricultural policy and this is why we've got agriculture er being introduced into the g a t not only does it impose huge costs on domestic tax payers and consumers it also in UNK erm a large cost on third country UNK right now if you think that most of those countries may well be developing countries and agricultural output is their only source of foreign exchange erm then er the policies of the rich countries in the west are erm a actively erm UNK the development prospects of developing countries alright and that may not be the desired intention
okay thanks very much
well are we ready to go
i feel a bit like henry the fifth once more into the breach
er UNK on er we actually got to number eight this morning didn't we
can i can i ask er contributions short and sharp
please so we can finish at a reasonable hour
otherwise we shall be having conflicts with the amateur UNK society
so we go into and i'm r reading the schedule as submitted by mr eight little a another fact is regional sub regional policies and if you will recall we council's wording was be consistent with regional and sub regional policies
now how many of the sectors as again as defined ones which we've agreed we will examine er would fit or would be con would be consistent with regional sub regional policies or would possibly cause conflict with those if er they were the receiving the receiving area for a new settlement
or do you take the assessment which mr has done which er indicates that they are all of equal er merit or rank
mr
dave leeds city council
you've heard me often already chairman on this point
i don't think i need to repeat leeds view about the implications for regeneration in inner leeds and west yorkshire
er yes but be precise about the sectors mr
which are the sectors where you feel if you had a new settlement er there would be potential er problems if that's the right word for the implementation of your regeneration policies in leeds
dave leeds city council
the sectors of particular concern to leeds are in particular the a sixty four corridor south west sector and depending on location the a fifty nine corridor may have implications
yes
so that's selby west and possibly harrogate
is that it
that's correct chairman
that's correct chairman
thank you
any anyone else want to make a point on this
good can we move on to the next one
infrastructure
do you want t well yes county council criteria was to be acceptable in respect of the provisions of essential infrastructure particularly surface water and foul drainage and water supply
but it was agreed was it not that er there ought to be coupled with that it seems appropriate when you're talking about water supplies
er avoid the flood plain and be acceptable in the context of surface water drainage
in other words er would be would not cause problems or ra raise objection from the n r a because it would conflict with their responsibilities
erm any of the sectors that have been identified erm give cause for concern on that score
no
y you were first on the draw mr
michael
sir it dealing with drainage matters i think there's general agreement from yorkshire water that the preference is the new settlement should drain should either g be within i think i put it detailed figures in my in my statement
i think it's three miles from the er UNK works or going to the east york main link sewer
that would mean you would be looking at something on the a sixty four north or happily for mr the a sixty four south or the a nineteen south
the a nineteen north the a fifty nine and b one s three six three would be less favoured for those reasons
as brief as i can be sir
very UNK
mr
without commenting on the or any sector i think the conclusions on these three elements that's surface water foul drainage and er water supply may be different in respect of each sector
it's not it's not as straightforward the conclusions in respect of one may not necessarily apply in respect of the other
well
and i don't know the answer
i suspect neither at the moment do the er do the national rivers authority or the water authority
i know there may be variation in degree as it were according to which particular aspect of infrastructure you're looking at
but is there likely to be anything which would be absolutely overriding
or which would lead on to conclude that one sector is preferable to another
what you're saying is there's a shortage of information
at the moment i think there is yes
a definitive statement
what about the point which mr raised made
well i wouldn't want to comment on that because i don't have the information to er to set against anything mr
is to is to discuss the detail of the issues in respect of those three those three elements
would you like to ex sorry mr would you like to expand on that last point
i mean do you want to go through each one
no
the county council's position is it doesn't feel able at the moment to express a definitive view on these three elements in respect of er of either sector
of any of the sectors that in er
you haven't done any of these exercises
not in detail no
mr do you want to
yes sir
just
michael
sir you'll have seen the county planning officer's own report on these matters and you'll have seen exactly the same comments which i've made contained in that report
the county have done initial work on this and come to exactly the same conclusions which we have
agricultural land quality
any sector which is less favoured or more favoured as a result of a shall i say a UNK overview on agricultural land quality
miss
UNK
er the county council's own document january ninety two actually sets out erm the various regions around the around the york area and the general g grades of agricultural quality
they've pointed out that the area to the south and the west is generally much higher agricultural land than elsewhere
are you UNK us to look at that then
sorry am i
are you UNK us to look at that and UNK
yes i am
well it won't have changed so
UNK digest
mr
paul partnership
er the only point i wish to make is that there is considerable UNK we have found in the grading erm and the ministry of agriculture maps can not be relied upon for relatively small er or larger areas
and erm in that respect i believe er that this particular factor as all of the other factors under er item eight er it requires really site specific investigation
well we shall than thank you mr
we shall UNK our memories on the information already supplied to us
mr
michael
sir we are obviously dealing here with a new settlement of ve very extensive land take i think that the there are certainly been quite a there's been a lot of detailed work done by the various erm UNK around the table today about agricultural land quality
i think it is fair to say that erm all the detailed surveys which have been taken have tended to support the findings from the one to fifty thousand map in so far that the various developments proposed to the west and to the south have include quite large elements of grade two land whereas the se proposals to the north a tend to be grade three land
and again one would te under p g seven one would tend to those UNK
mr did you want to come back on that one
or was it thank you
can we move on then
archaeology and nature conservation
erm county council wording had avoid areas of archaeological nature conservation importance
erm i take it mr that is what your item heading actually UNK does it
it does sir yes
yes
are there any sectors where there are for example UNK s is which are of er how shall i put it strategic scale that could influence er the location of a new settlement
i see from your nature conservation strategy document that you have got some UNK s is er
i
within the area of search
mhm
but for some reason some of them may well lie within the
mm
in the flood plain for example
yes i think
do any of those come into play
erm i would think by and large in practical terms erm they do not i'm immediately thinking of the erm er on the UNK
erm some of which would be in the area of search but i think practically for obviously drainage reasons they wouldn't be a UNK factor
the other one that immediately comes to mind is er is UNK common but that of course is within the greenbelt erm anyway
yes
i wouldn't have thought er that er on archaeology and nature conservation which really is erm a matter of er detailed site consideration that er it would be a fundamental matter in the er in the location of a new settlement
i don't know whether our colleagues would agree or not on that
so i wouldn't yes i'd accept that probably er a tick in each probably would er would be a reasonable assumption
yes
it's far too UNK and site specific to
it does tend to
actually come into play at the strategic level
yes i think that's a reasonable er summary yeah
yeah
even in spite of the advice given in p g three
yeah
er moving on pardon
moving on then to UNK form which in the expanded form would be UNK and avoid coalescence with existing settlements
now then
chairman er peter north yorkshire
i would have thought again that er that criteria could reasonably be e be expected to be accommodated with er within each of the sectors
yes i recall on friday morning we had this discussion about the wording which you had in the er
mm
in h two nine be UNK and well removed from
but i don't want to raise that one again
no
now then
move on then to minerals considerations
sorry mr i moved too quickly for you
er flaxton
are you going to produce your great white spots again as distinct from mr
erm
's black spots
i'll make brief reference to them
erm the question of coalescence UNK form is in my opinion of more importance in regard to some corridors th some sectors than others
i believe that in the evaluation of sectors that we're now engaged in it is possible as a strategic exercise to exclude entirely number six the a sixty four north eastern corridor on coalescence questions
but i would first start with a slightly wider issue
er namely the density of settlements
and i did a diagram which i think everybody has showing broadly the density as we have it
if one looks at that erm built area where we are now that looks perhaps like a UNK on a UNK and looks immediately east of that you have UNK common most of which is a restricted area
and the outer boundary of the greenbelt proposed by the county council slightly closer in than the existing outer boundary at that point is UNK with the boundary of the UNK throwing range
between it and the boundary of the UNK hills area of outstanding natural beauty at UNK bridge the distance is only three and a half kilometres just over two miles there is therefore a narrow corridor not designated either as greenbelt or a o n b which naturally er comes under rather heavier pressure perhaps than er areas round it might
therefore in looking at this diagram one needs to realize that to the UNK er and just east of er UNK erm the area is filled up by greenbelt
there are in fact very few areas UNK the a sixty four north east than one needs to look at
there is perhaps one northeast of flaxton village another south of it and another UNK of the a sixty four
taking the last first there are three villages which are so close together that with any allowance for coalescence even the one UNK which i believe was taken in the original look at this problem by the county council there would be no possibility of fitting in a settlement er of the size proposed
and here i ought to perhaps make it clear that the circles i provided on the sheet which was distributed allow for a density of twenty houses per hectare
mhm
if one goes to the slightly higher figure which would be more appropriate for inner UNK development then instead of my cut out for the land UNK map for one and a half square kilometres one hundred and fifty hectares one can take the new ten penny piece
that w that is exactly at twenty five and that is allowing a doubling of the housing area to allow for all the other features that come within the new settlement
the er commercial employment land shopping erm community facilities infrastructure etcetera
i don't think that would be likely to be argued against
if one comes to the are northeast of flaxton i believe that for the UNK of coalescence one ought in the case of a village which has a rather wide boundary conservation area for historical reasons basically one ought to take the coalescence distance from the edge of that conservation boundary
and that is shown in the appendix to the position statement put in by flaxton
if one allows even the minimum that was UNK by north yorkshire one finds that there is no room left in the triangle surrounded by the railway the a sixty four and the conservation area of flaxton
it is impossible
i commend that exercise to you but won't go into more detail about it now
to the south or UNK of flaxton a fairly similar problem arises
if one took the distance as only one UNK and we regard that as absolutely insufficient for a village of the character of flaxton we would prefer one and a half miles or two point four kilometres as the minimum
but if one takes only one UNK again there is insufficient room for a settlement which would not be close up against the greenbelt boundary proposed by the county council and close up against the a sixty four
it is just impossible to fit it in
i cannot see any other potential locations for a new settlement UNK the a sixty four corridor in addition to the three i have just mentioned and i believe that on that basis it would be reasonable from the strategic point of view to exclude sector six
mhm
you've just introduced a new method of measurement for all planners mr
but yes thank you i do take the point
in other words on this particular aspect approach with caution sector six
yes
yes i would go further than that but that is stating my view as at its minimum
approach with caution yes
yes
yeah
thank you
miss
UNK
sir i'd like to bring your attention to erm a plan prepared by partnership which is submitted as part of their evidence which erm sets out for the south and UNK the er coalescence of existing settlements
first of all i'd like to point out that some of the existing settlements haven't actually been UNK for example UNK selby
but it's obvious from a quick glance that plan that in fact a number of those settlements are already UNK in the form of a definition of a one UNK around the village and there are actually very few areas outside of the greenbelt in that zone which could possibly accommodate a new settlement of the size we're UNK without causing coalescence
that reference was to which sectors
well it's the south UNK area
it it's actually probably south and south UNK
it's selby east and selby west isn't it
if i as i recall
number two i think is the er
yes
two primarily and possibly one as i as i as i remember
yes
that's right
the plan which you produced mr it UNK virtually the whole of the selby district doesn't it
yes sir it does
thank you
yes
er mr first and then mr
the revised criteria and as you've just read it out i think for consistency with paragraph thirty three of p g three there needs to be the word unacceptable coalescence
and i think if you look at lessons such as the cambridge situation you can have distances of separation between a new village and surrounding settlements and it's as little as six hundred metres depending on UNK matters
and my view is that within the a sixty four corridor north east there is sufficient range of sites to be found that it should not be erm set to one side on this criterion
i must confess mr i had some difficulty with the wording of p g there when it says unacceptable coalescence er and trying to balance that against the expressed aim that this should be UNK
and if it's UNK then you can't have coalescence acceptable or otherwise surely can you
you might there are certain new settlement proposals that have been put forward in other parts of the country which has been basically a bolt on to er an existing group of
yeah
perhaps i could
which might be acceptable
seek some clarification as to the way in which the county council defines a settlement
when is a settlement not a settlement
no
yes i sorry i mean there may be a UNK point may there UNK there
mr
thank you sir
just on a point of er clarification the villages or settlements i should say that i've indicated on the er plan which is included within my statement er is actually derived from the selby rural areas local plan which defines settlements and i believe the county council have used a similar erm listing of erm settlements within that those two sectors for their own exercise when they looked at this particular subject er criteria
thank you
thank you
mr
michael very briefly we my clients have two settlements new two ne new settlements proposed along the a sixty four corridor
both have been designed to meet fully the requirements a set out by the county council and we're quite happy we can actually meet that requirement of being one UNK from flaxton in fact we greatly exceed that distance despite and that is a on the design of a larger new settlement than fourteen hundred dwellings
so as a matter of fact we can we can actually fulfil their requirement
thank you
are you to hazard a guess about when is a settlement not a settlement
no i'm not at the moment
erm can i just say just on the on the basis of mr 's map erm i think that proves the point that er that i suggested at the outset of the discussion erm on this issue that if you look at the distribution of settlements there outside the greenbelt there's nothing there that suggests that any of the particular sectors ought to be discounted
erm i think it's a reasonable starting point that there's a reasonably level playing field on the basis of er erm of that issue
and i wouldn't agree therefore with mr or indeed with er miss that er either sectors within that general framework erm should be discounted
on the same basis there are some sectors er which have less settlements than indeed som if any than others
well i think that's perhaps a matter of slight degree it's again
so the UNK the question then is UNK whether you would accord anything erm any weighting to that
well no the issue is whether any sector is to be discounted because of the distribution of settlements it would be on balance difficult to find a location for a new settlement within that sector
i think that is the issue and on the basis of the distribution of settlements er now there's nothing there to suggest to me that er there's anything other than the level playing field at the outset of perhaps of that exercise
fine thank you
anybody else want to make any comment on that
can we move on to minerals considerations
erm and we come back to the county's wording which is avoid conflict between mineral and non mineral development
erm and i have to say that er i mean if for example this was to well assuming we had h two policy then wouldn't you expect to make some cross reference here to your ei policy m eight in your approved structure plan
i think that erm yeah as a matter of principle that wouldn't be erm UNK
you will notice in the structure plan as a whole there is very little cross UNK between any of the policies in there
yes
er i as i recollect it that was largely the view the secretary of state took when he when he approved the plan and indeed there is a relationship between most of the policies
and you need to look at the policies as a whole rather than individually
that's right yes yeah
but people sometimes fall into the trap
yeah
in looking at individual policies
yes
or selecting those which
at the exclusion of others yes
yes
yeah
anybody want to make any comment on this
mr
thank you sir paul partnership
mr submitted this morning a letter from british coal erm i just wanted to place on record the fact that erm this is no more than erm a UNK of a previous holding objection to my client's erm proposal for a new settlement within selby district
i would like to say that there have been no negotiations with british coal erm in relation to this objection as the application is currently in UNK as it's obviously subject to a section fourteen direction but i don't see anything in there erm which erm UNK the general conclusions er that i've put in my supplementary paper on this particular criterion
mr
UNK michael
sir er sir the i think i would not for a moment argue that minerals considerations can be UNK overriding in this matter
clearly they should not be
however they do go into the balance
it's quite clear from the british coal letter that there is extreme concern about by the operator of the UNK about the effect of any new settlement along either the a nineteen south or the a sixty four south corridor
and this is a matter which must be given some weight in decision when you combine it with the other factors also which we have gone through today
mr
if i can just make er paul partnership
if i could just make one closing remark on this particular issue
the question of the selby UNK has not been seen as a constraint on other forms of development erm peripheral expansion of villages and so on within the UNK area
do you wish to make any comment on this one point
not specifically other than obviously we don't know at the moment
yeah
whether it is a real constraint in terms of erm of UNK a er a new settlement
i guess again that's something that needs to be looked at in the context of the er of british UNK ongoing program of work in the selby area
well we have come to the end of mr 's list
the other one vaguely at the back of my mind it was raised this morning cos i recall mr made a comment on it and that is erm looking at the growth implications beyond two thousand and six
are there any sectors where that may be acceptable or unacceptable
or is it something which just has to be considered as part of the planning process
when you're dealing with a specific proposal
mr
i would say that it's a general UNK and it er UNK the erm size that one should have regard to potentially in looking at the matter from the local plan point of view
i would say that it's UNK to this exercise again in so far as it might lead to the conclusion that a particular sector is UNK
yes that i yes
yeah
that is assuming of course that you would then go b much beyond the f the fourteen hundred figure which has been identified
erm just as an example in the UNK distributed the three square kilometres the three hundred hectares is erm er double of course the area that i took up to two thousand and six of one and a half
yes
yeah
can we take it mr that you would therefore apply the same comments to sector six on this criterion as you did to the UNK criterion
indeed i would
i think that the UNK development pressures which would develop by two thousand and six in the case of a successful new settlement would be such that there would be a severe risk of UNK within that distance that one had years earlier adopted as the necessary clearance between and existing settlement and the new settlement
one should therefore have regard to as far as possible the UNK size
yes
yeah
thank you
has anyone else i think we've exhausted the criteria er appraisal as it were
what i'd ask for now er erm is a sort of general UNK up summing up UNK on my left hand side
miss is just saying to me that a quick review of her chart er could indicate that we haven't got any clear er how shall i say clear indication using the same word twice that would point us to one sector only
in other words in other words
if i may chairman
i only highlight that to encourage those who are going to be making er UNK to p UNK up their summary
please
yes
michael
sir i having listened to the discussion nearly two days two and a half days it seems to me that i come very firmly with the conclusion that the a f a fifty nine the a nineteen north and b one three six corridors are simply not practical
mainly on highway grounds
the a fifty nine has a number of constraints upon it including best and most versatile agricultural land its difficulty of UNK a new settlement but as i say most importantly for highway reasons
the a nineteen north very similar reasons but we have the added reason that the local planning authority hambledon clearly will not accept such a new settlement
and very similar constraints on b one three six three corridor
that leaves you then with three corridors to consider
the a nineteen south the a sixty four south and the a sixty four north
again the a nineteen south has a major highway constraint upon it and it's very difficult to see how that could be overcome
and i in my opinion the a nineteen south in particular should be dismissed for highway reasons
it simply cannot accommodate the traffic flows which would be generated
which leaves two corridors which are the a sixty four south and the and the a sixty four north
the a sixty four south again there are highway difficulties you will see from the note which we put out the extent of di of over capacity on the a sixty four south
you have heard the frequently repeated comments by almost all of the participants of the difficulties this would cause to the regeneration of leeds
it has the added difficulty of the minerals problems
it also has the added difficulty that it cannot be effectively served by rail
i think for all those reasons it is should not be preferred
the a in comparison the a sixty four north has i think o scores better on almost all of the criteria
it won't it is accepted that the new settlement new settlement can be UNK into the landscape
it is accepted that there isn't any significant minerals constraint and it's accepted that there isn't any high well there isn't the same quantity of best and most versatile agricultural land
which brings me really to the factors which i give the most weight to
most im very importantly it is the area where i think there's agreement almost around the table that it is it will be the area which will best meet the greater york needs rather than needs of leeds or elsewhere in greater york
that i think is a factor which you must give importance to given the views of the secretary of state
it is also the area where you have the most the best transport choice of the practical corridors
we know as a matter o that the roads wh when UNK the road when UNK will have sufficient c capacity
we know that it already has a very good bus service
and but most importantly it is there is also the potential for a rail link
i think that it best meets that very important criterion
and i think that's all i need to say at this point
thank you mr
mr are you going to run some horses through this particular race
erm roy house UNK federation
i said some days ago that i would have difficulty er UNK you in making the choice for some obvious reasons
erm i'm still obviously in that position that position hasn't changed
i think i would simply say that er if you feel you can make a choice so be it if you feel you can't make a choice i would UNK you to take up some wording similar to the wording i've suggested which seeks to commit the district authorities to a to a new settlement within greater york
albeit there's no sector location
because as i've said to you before i think it's very important that a new settlement is provided somewhere within greater york
mr
paul partnership
sir i think i have the advantage over most round the table if not all that i have actually put in to you a paper which i think sets out very clearly the basis of my er choice of the a sixty four south erm sector and i won't reiterate those points
i would just like to make a couple of general points though regarding selby district as a location
erm first of all i think alternative sites can be found within the district which meet the requirements of p g three erm set out in paragraph thirty three and i think the other advantage which perhaps hasn't been touched on is that the new settlement in selby district would balance the otherwise very heavy bias of recent and future UNK development which is er to the north east of york
particularly within ryedale district
and also i think you've heard that er selby district council er wish to u use the er york new settlement as a very positive part of their own strategy to accommodate development within er their own northern areas to relieve development pressures erm on their villages
the second point which i would make is that despite having had many months indeed years to come to a view erm it is only selby district council who have stepped forward and said basically that they would be prepared to accommodate the new settlement
the other districts have had plenty of opportunity to say so but they have not and i believe that can be taken that they are not UNK to a new settlement within their district regardless of whether they're in favour of the principle of it
and i think it is important in the greater york context that the york new settlement be located in a district which is enthusiastic about the concept of developing a new settlement because to do otherwise i think will undermine the role er function of the new settlement
and that really leads me up er leads me to my final point which i think it is essential to plan for success with this new settlement
erm i've indicated this morning that i think the employment component of the new settlement is an absolutely crucial part of the overall concept and unless you get a very good employment area all the other objectives for the new settlement will not be achieved
and i think there is very clear evidence that a location along the a sixty four corridor to the south erm west or york is most likely in the greater york context to produce a good employment area
thank you
thank you miss
UNK
i consider that the a sixty four south erm corridor should be eliminated from consideration for the following reasons
erm a proposal of the new settlement in this corridor would be contrary to regional and sub regional policy
erm it would undermine west UNK policy of urban regeneration by creating a UNK which would erm lead to further migration into the york area it would therefore not serve york well
erm i consider also that erm a development in this area would UNK on the sensitive gap between the york and west yorkshire UNK and would be likely to cause coalescence between the fairly UNK located villages in this sector
we've heard from michael about the access problems on this corridor erm he's produced figures that show that this particular route is over design capacity
i'd also like to point out that erm due to the isolation of much of the area in the sector erm n new access to a new settlement would be very UNK on the landscape
the area is erm in the main flat UNK and it would be very difficult to erm landscape effectively any new settlement proposal or roads serving it
erm this sector of land also contains a high proportion of high grade agricultural land and should therefore be avoided
erm i in addition british UNK coal have plans to undermine much of this area up to and beyond two thousand and six
these plans would be UNK by a new settlement in this location
that's it
is that it
yes
you're not proposing any other sector which might be a suitable home
no
i'm not
i'm not
i mean i know the point which has been pursued by before
mr standing in for mr
yes i'm afraid i've come in as a last minute substitute and i feel as if in the eighty ninth minute i've been given a penalty to take that could win the match or
missing it could mess us up so i apologize
erm i i've no wish to run through all the points er again that erm mr and er miss have made in regard to the UNK sector
erm i think that you know where we're coming from which i think the phrase you've used before
erm we question the need completely for a new settlement and we question that on the basis of population projection which we believe are reasonable
we're not seeking to impose artificial UNK of development we don't think the demand for a settlement is there
certainly not within the period of the current structure plan
we feel that the development that we admit is necessary can UNK be spread around the constituent authorities and we've heard nothing i would submit that goes against that
you sir i would UNK have found at every turn uncertainty amongst the local authorities and a and a lack of UNK amongst the greater york authorities as to whether there should be a settlement and where it should go
which i which we would suggest is indicative of the fact that there is no overriding demand which is what obviously for the purposes of p g three you are looking for
with particular regard to the interests of our client other than taking an overview we obviously have to look specifically at the UNK sector as a as a possible location
erm the principle aim of the new settlement would be to meet the needs of greater york and one area that i'm afraid hasn't been considered yet but which i think may well come out in connection with the employment policies in due course is whether or not a new settlement in selby would actually conflict with the underlying policies of selby for development
it would actually be competing for development that selby wants for its own population
erm once the development er that would have been g going into selby actually goes into the new settlement then it's me it's either meeting the new UNK er sorry the it's either meeting the goals of greater york in which case that's been taken away from selby or it's UNK for selby
erm a new factory going into the area for example will have a choice between one of UNK erm can't think of a suitable UNK large requirement for industrial land or it will go into the new settlement
in our view the simple fact that selby are prepared to take it erm shouldn't carry that much weight
i mean we have to make a sensible planning decision on where it should go and the fact that one authority is prepared to put its hand up when the others clearly aren't should not be the main determining factor
that's all i have thank you
thank you
a volunteer is better than a pressed man
mr
the c p r e er remains opposed to the basic principle of the new settlement on the grounds that have already been discussed it's not needed it's not sustainable and it's inconsistent with current and emerging guidance
however erm if you as a panel are one minded to go for the new settlement option and two er minded to make a UNK recommendation about particular geographical locations or sectors erm i for one would be very concerned that this would be done on the basis of insufficient technical erm information
erm you have in front of you er background material that's been submitted by way of statement and erm a half a day of discussion today plus this evening
i conclude from that the technical information on all the sectors is at best UNK erm and where it's comprehensive it's come from people who are advocating a particular development proposal
and it's certainly not available in sufficient detail for all of the sectors to make a fair comparison and i think mr has made this point in when you've questioned him a number of times today that the information is just not available or to hand to make to make that comparison
erm i look forward to hearing mr 's views on this particular matter given that he was the or the department was responsible for in a sense UNK the discussion to consider the breakdown of locations and as to whether he feels that there is sufficient technical information available on all of the sectors should a recommendation come forward for a particular sector from the panel
if you as a panel conclude that the information erm is inadequate clearly er on that basis then a suggestion would have to be made as to one how this matter can be progressed
and from c p r UNK point of view we would feel that the best way to do that is to is to UNK if that's the right word the forum of greater york authorities to look in more detail at each of the sectors and under undertake the technical comparison i think in a in a fair and reasonable way which i don't think we've really we've really achieved during erm three hours of discussion today
thank you
thank you mr do you want to make a contribution on that
yes please chairman erm as you've already heard leeds concerns are principally with the UNK corridor the a sixty four corridor and to a lesser extent with the a fifty nine
our concerns arise in relation to the new settlement of fourteen hundred households which we see as a quite different animal to the dispersed development proposed in harrogate craven and so on
that concern is UNK if the UNK intended to have growth potential beyond two thousand and six and UNK still further if it's likely to be the focus of major employment development either in the short or longer term
the problems with these i think are principally of two kinds
firstly effect on regeneration of the di UNK investment which would be likely to arise and that's as has been already mentioned that's contrary to the strategic guidance for west yorkshire
but also the increase in road commuting on routes into leeds which are already severely affected and recognized as such by the department of transport and by the city council
leeds has received objections to its own u d p which proposed new settlements just beyond the ten miles on the a sixty four corridor as well as elsewhere in east leeds
if the panel were minded to recognize south west corridor as the location for a new settlement in north yorkshire then this is bound to influence the consideration which the city council can give to those particular objections
thank you
thank you
mr
flaxton
mr made reference to the development which has taken place round york in recent years
and to the fact that ryedale has taken much greater share of that development than the other districts round york
in fact this procedure has one on over twenty years at least
but it's proposed to continue and if one looks at table n y thirteen UNK today one sees that the residential land supply in and around greater york up to two thousand and six UNK the new settlement shows that out of a total of between eight thousand three hundred and eighty and eight thousand seven hundred and fifty dwellings between three thousand eight hundred and ninety and four thousand one hundred and sixty are UNK for ryedale
indeed the settlement where we are at this moment is to be expanded very considerably
this kind of thing has an important influence on the degree to which congestion can arise
and there is undoubtedly a high degree of movement from some of the new settlements here and in UNK into the city centre as compared with some other locations round
congestion is er towards the northeast and the north
day by day
i referred earlier to coalescence as being as an extremely important factor
i regard it as one of the two most important factors set out by d o e in paragraph thirty three
the other is of course the question of a need for positive environmental improvement if that can be gained
through the UNK of derelict land or the UNK of areas of low landscape value
i will commend to the panel paragraph two point one point three of ryedale district council's position statement on policy h two with which we wholly agree
i hope that the panel will feel that it has had as a result of the position statements before it and the discussions over the last few days sufficient information to decide whether to exclude certain sectors
i certainly think that there has been enough information to do that and i would suggest that sectors four five and six can readily be excluded
as between the other three i have not expressed a particular preference but because no developer has come forward in connection with sector three there has perhaps been less detailed attention paid to that sector the a fifty nine than to others
one should not UNK the UNK of having the railway line which goes fairly directly to the station on a regional railways route and one should not UNK the importance of having a UNK road which does not go through or otherwise influence villages between it and the centre of york
one should also i believe have regard for both the UNK sector of york and this sector the a fifty nine the choices for traffic in coming to the city on reaching the outer ring road and the inner ring road
i believe that distribution possibilities are possibly better er for erm the south west and the north west er than or the erm er north east
i entirely agree with the comments which have been made by mr with regard to congestion resulting from erm commuting from the northeast at the present day
that is all i would say in conclusion
thank you very much
erm go to mr and then mr
come back to mr towards the end
in view of all the information and advice that has been given during the course of this planning discussion i'm firmly of the opinion that sectors three four and five do not fully comply with the requirement of p g three
however in looking at sectors one two and three i think there are two important issues to consider one is the ability of any one sector to UNK the use of public transport facilities and to encourage their improvement
i think all those three sectors have the ability to do that
the other consideration is clearly one of the threat of coalescence
because this is indeed one of the important criteria set out in p g three that is the question to respect local preference as well as have the support of the local authority
it is for this reason therefore that i think that sector six is more likely to threaten coalescence with existing communities than sectors one or two
we have heard that selby district has the capacity to absorb a new settlement the will to absorb a new settlement and indeed the need for a new settlement to
it is for this reason that i suggest therefore that the preferred areas of search should be confined to the corridors of selby west or selby east
thank you
thank you very much
can i just clarify i'm sorry
it's alright
it's alright mr
mr you ruled out initially sectors three four and five
three four and five
you r did i understand correctly that you ruled out sector six on grounds of coalescence
sector six because there's more chance of the threat of coalescence within that sector
i'm grateful thank you
mr
chris wood UNK
it is my view that when you look at all the locational criteria contained in policy h two and as we've discussed them you'll reach the conclusion that there is one corridor that best meets those criterion is the a sixty four northeast of york sector six
i consider that this is this conclusion is reached having regard to the following seven points
firstly the a sixty four is to be UNK in the national road programme
when it's UNK the road will have the spare capacity to accommodate a new settlement and we've heard that there is no department of transport objections to a new settlement along the a sixty four northeast of york
secondly there are no mineral workings in the a sixty four northeast sector
thirdly there is limited high quality agricultural land within that sector
UNK there is scope to UNK a new settlement into the landscape without coalescence
there is extensive areas of UNK many commercial UNK which can become the starting point for UNK the new village
UNK a location northeast of york for important reasons that have already been identified will minimize the impact upon would minimize the impact of the new development upon the west yorkshire conurbation and the objectives of urban regeneration that are taking place there
UNK a new settlement to the northeast of york on the a sixty fi e a sixty four would be well located to existing employment retail and leisure development that's taken place there
i draw your attention to the plan at appendix five of my statement
i mean you can see it's self evident as you travel to UNK that development has been highly successful and s and the s the final seventh point is that the a sixty four north east corridor can be well served by the public transport to achieve the close relationship between the workplace and home as national policy now seeks
and you can the new v village can bring forward with it a park and ride initiative that will UNK other such initiatives taking place around york
thank you
thank you very much
do any of the districts want to be drawn on a choice or are you still maintaining the line which you have UNK in maintaining since we embarked on this discussion on thursday where we have two districts well sorry mr and mr not agreeing in principle with the new settlement
er do you want to pursue any point on that
no
mr and mr
please
mr
UNK er harrogate borough council
i think er what this exercise today has shown us is that only about half the factors in h two er have a strategic dimension in so far as they would affect a choice between broad sectors around york
er the other half of the factors really do depend on detailed site conditions and cannot easily form part of a strategic assessment
i don't think we've heard enough here to make the choice i think we need to look at both strategic and local factors in the co on a comprehensive and comparable basis
i think that really does lead us back to the starting point which is the county council's view that er that comprehensive study needs to be done as a matter of urgency and steps are being taken to get that work moving very soon now
and er i think all the exercise today has UNK the common sense of that approach
thank you
add anything to that mr
or are you just going to concur with what he said
i'd agree with it fully
thank you
mr
sorry mr
yes er michael hambledon district council
i don't think i need to say anything further on the council's erm position on the new settlement erm or reiterate UNK earlier view that it's n its er view that the settlement is not needed and cannot be justified
in relation to erm mr 's point erm i would raise one particular point of concern and erm this is the possibility of delay in identifying a district and an area if this step by step approach is adopted
erm at UNK and UNK session last week we heard the possibility of a further erm e i p to consider the issue erm introducing a possible delay of another eighteen er months er before more s specific strategic guidance would be available on this issue
erm hambledon believes erm not UNK its overall objection that such a delay is unacceptable
particularly because of its im its implications on district wide local plan preparation
erm it would be difficult for greater york authorities erm other than york to progress their district wide local plans until the UNK been resolved
erm and i'd remind the panel of the statements in p g twelve erm paragraph three seven that the government expects to see substantially complete coverage er for district wide local plans within five years
now irrespective of what substantially complete coverage means or from one t when one takes the five year period the message is clear erm local authorities are expected to get on with their district wide local plans and i believe that this step by step approach on the new settlement is going to introduce delays into district wide local plan preparation
thank you for that
mr
d o e thank you sir
sorry
d o e er i'm sure that members of the panel appreciate why i've remained silent during the discussion of item two d but does anyone in the room who doesn't fully understand it's simply that the secretary of state of exercises role in relation to a new settlement
he may for instance need to intervene at the modification stage of the structure plan or it could be that he will have to deal with appeals against non determination of applications made by prospective developers
or he could even be faced with the prospect of calling about individual applications or even heaven UNK the structure plan itself
one point the department is very clear on the section paragraph five thirteen of p g twelve is as crystal clear as it could be the structure plan should indicate the general location of individual developments likely to have a significant effect on the plan area
i find it difficult to imagine a form of development which would have a much more significant impact than that of a new settlement
we therefore feel it is absolutely vital that if there is to be a new settlement it should come forward through the structure plan
the question posed in er item two d should the policy include specific guidance on the location of the new settlement we would hope that in the light of what you've heard and in the light of the statement i've just read out that you would have no difficulty coming to a conclusion on that question just as it stands
i fear however in view of what we've heard from the two sides of the table you will have rather more difficulty in coming even to a recommendation as to specific guidance on which sector of greater york this new settlement should be located if indeed you are minded to recommend in favour of one at all
we would have hoped that the county and district councils would have so organized their selection processes that they could have come to this examination in public fully prepared to argue the merits of geographical location
we have heard many times why that has not been possible and it's no good crying over UNK milk as they say in these parts
it's a question of what happens from now on that's very important
i believe it's the intention of the authorities to try and do some very detailed work over the coming months then armed with that detailed assessment and hopefully armed with your recommendations they may aim to be pr proceed to the modification step of the structure plan in a way that which will lead to a speedy conclusion
i find difficulty believing that they will be able to do that simply because the detailed assessment that has been done to date as we've heard so many times is UNK
but th the county council may yet surprise us on that score
all i would say is that when the plan reaches modification stage the department will be looking at that the situation very closely indeed and at that stage i would fully expect that even though i won't be here to do it myself as i shall have retired by that stage
i feel it is more than likely that the department will be making a submission to ministers at that stage in the proceedings
just how they react obviously will depend on the state of play which has been reached
all i would wish to say to you now sir is i hope you will feel able to make a recommendation on the direct question should the policy include specific guidance
if you are feel able to go one step further and make specific guidance as to sectors in the way we've described by reference to physical features that would be fine
but i fear that you may not be able to do that
at the end of our statement sir we did make reference to the er removal possible removal of the article fourteen
and i noticed at one point in the discussion this was UNK by h b f i think they UNK that we wouldn't at that stage we'd be opening up free for all of the kind which we've obviously been seeking to avoid thus far
you'll notice though in our statement it did say on completion of the formal modification processes
and we of course in our UNK that would mean on completion of the selection process if a new settlement is to be part of the plan
we wouldn't expect the county council to be proceeding to approval of the plan but merely an approval in principle or an approval of the concept
we would expect them to be proceeding on the basis of a specific sector a general location in sufficient detail to enable them to place a symbol on the key diagram in the approximate location where they think a new settlement should go
and it was on that basis that we made that statement there
that's that remains our intention we wouldn't want this article fourteen direction to remain in force UNK even though g the g d o said that we can do that
we wouldn't wish to do that but nor would we want to open up a free for all
we would want this to be seen UNK through approval of the structure plan to be taken up in r in the relevant local plan and for that relevant local plan to then sort out competing claims from prospective developments in mu in much the same sort of exercise as we've seen in the structure plan but obviously in a more detailed way
so we would hope that by UNK that article fourteen direction at that stage all we would really be doing is making it possible for the l particular local plan to receive more specific UNK from real life applications within the general locations specified in the structure plan
beyond that clearly i can't go
if that stage has not been reached at the end of the formal application processes it UNK not for me to judge now what the UNK do
but that's what lay behind the statement there
and i think that's all i would wish to say sir unless you've any further questions
no that's fine mr thank you
there is mr the outstanding question about when is a settlement not a settlement but before that i found this quick s this round the table summing up very useful
mm
if nothing for the fact that the message that is coming home loud and clear is this request for clarification the UNK of certainty one way or another
er and i again i have to say that we have not come to any conclusions about the new settlement but certainly if there is to be a new settlement then generally people would like more certainty
erm we've heard about the measured approach the step by step approach er and mr has said please make your mind up one way or another so we can proceed with our local plan preparation
my question to mr which he might like to comment on in his summing up is we've heard about the forthcoming meeting which you're going to arrange with the district council's how soon would you be able to make progress
would when would you be in a position to clarify to your colleagues never mind anybody else when would you be in a position to clarify which way forward
if we were minded to go down the new settlement line
north yorkshire
well can i say first of all that the meeting to which you refer will take place this coming monday and i suspect that it will be the first of possibly two or three meetings which i suspect are going to follow rather quickly one after the other
er i suspect that through december and into early january we would be moving towards agreement er hopefully agreement on the location for the new settlement
so that into the turn of the year i can't be any more precise er than that certainly we would hope to be seeing er the wood er from the trees
and quite clearly there is a lot of work that needs to be done because if we look back on the discussion this afternoon er this morning er and this evening quite clearly there are conflicting views and conflicting interpretations about various criteria various elements of information that should er should go into the mix
erm as i digest mr 's comments and the various implications erm of the things that he said it's more and more UNK for me that perhaps we may well be right in the step by step measured approach because quite clearly erm i suspect that if we run at this stage a preferred location erm i suspect that the opposition to that and there would be opposition to it may well have may well prejudice the principle er of the new settlement
the county council's view has always been before you face that hurdle let's agree or get the principle accepted and then we move as quickly as we possible er as we possibly can towards a preferred erm location
that is our timescale i know the county members and certainly the three district council members are UNK to have this matter resolved because let's be perfectly fair it's been hanging around now since nineteen eighty nine in a sense
but it's been hanging for the l particular local plan to receive more specific UNK done this exercise properly
they've done it step by step and they've done nothing er to my mind that would prejudice full public consultation and public confidence erm er in the process
as i look back on what happened this morning and this evening er nothing i've er suggests to me that any one sector should be discounted at present and i think er on the basis of what i've heard at the moment erm all the sectors that er that we've discussed today er are still in the frame
we said it would be difficult erm and that discussion has proved how difficult it is to come to a firm conclusion
it may well be that weighting needs to be applied to er the various criteria and i think that elected members are the appropriate starting point for er applying er applying that weighting
because it may well be again that more specific area of search will meet all twelve on hundred percent erm of the criteria er that we er are putting forward
i did find the discussion interesting and UNK er it's gonna be a difficult task and i think that task for the county council and certainly three of the district councils starts on monday afternoon
thank you
well on that note i propose to conclude
the difficult question of what is a settlement is going to be answered by mr
oh yeah the settlement
malcolm county council
i feel as though i've been asked to define what is the length of a piece of string
i seem to recall i did once look in a dictionary to try and find out the definition of settlement all it said was something like a place where people settle
it didn't seem to be getting me very far
it seems to me there are there are several elements to definition of settlement
first there's the idea it is a place where people live
er it is not an industrial estate in the open countryside
i think the second element is that there must be some sense of a UNK identity erm so that the UNK development that one does tend to see in the countryside i don't believe UNK a settlement
and the third element is a question of size
i don't believe that a single farm with a collection of farm buildings around it UNK a settlement in the way that is normally used in planning terms
or that perhaps two or three dwellings together necessarily UNK a settlement
but i think that is very much a question of personal perception
trying to bring those elements together into a single definition i had to use an established grouping of permanent UNK
and more than that i'm afraid i cannot tell people
there is no definition in the approved structure plan
no
there isn't
thank you
thank you mr
on that note i propose to close the discussion on h two can i thank everybody for their participation their contribution
we found it extremely helpful
give us a headache of er where we take our thoughts from here
can i say also a particular thank you to the UNK sitting in the corner here
and without them we couldn't function properly
anyway thank you all very much er some of you we will see again tomorrow ten o'clock
this sunday
i'd like us to look back to that parable or part of that parable that jesus er told the folk it's in luke chapter fifteen
may well have guessed that already from er our service this morning
and let me just read you the it's quite a short parable this one
let me just read you the o the er the appropriate verses from luke fifteen and the opening seven verses
this is after perhaps with the possible exception of john fourteen this is perhaps the best known and best loved chapter in the gospel UNK
most folk no matter what they don't know have some UNK but it's not always correct of these UNK in luke fifteen the lost coin the lost sheep and the lost son
so let's just read those opening verses it says now all the tax UNK and the sinners were coming near jesus to listen to listen to him
and both the UNK and the UNK began to UNK saying this man receives sinners and eats with them and he told them this parable saying what man among you if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the open UNK and go out to the one which is lost until he finds it
and when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders UNK
and when he comes home he calls to gather his friends and his neighbours saying to them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
i tell you the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who UNK than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no UNK
you certainly don't have to be a bible UNK to read this chapter and realize that perhaps the key word in it is the word lost
and there are those who will tell us that really it's not one parable it's three UNK and there's some who think it's no it's really it's just the one parable with these three little sa parts of it
one could really argue that in fact there are four UNK there really
because you've got the er the story the account of the er the lost sheep you've got the lost coin you've also got the er parable or the story of the lost
the UNK son but you also have the second part of that which is almost a separate story of the son who had not gone into the far country
but in a sense it doesn't really matter whether it's one parable whether it's three UNK or whether it's four UNK it's what jesus was trying to teach to these people and over these next three weeks we're gonna be looking at these three er illustrations that jesus uses
again we see that one of the very important UNK that comes out of this is that people matter to god
now in a day in er in an age when people are don't really matter you know we UNK off statistics and they really are meaningless aren't they
you hear of UNK perhaps in i in the far east where hundreds thousands of people are killed in flooding and in the like and it's just numbers to us
and every single incident every single one of those people there i there is a UNK there is a human being there a and for every one of them there are perhaps hundreds of other people who are affected by that loss but it's just a number to us
it doesn't really mean a lot
we become immune to it
and it's good for us to recognise and to be aware and to realize that in a day when we are so often just numbers that as individuals we matter to god
and one of the things that jesus is bringing up particularly in this first se parable here the parable of the lost sheep is that he is concerned for that individual for that one person
you matter to god
not as a member of the human race but you matter to god as an individual as a person with all your strengths your weaknesses with all our UNK and our points as individuals we matter to god
another thing perhaps we should notice right at the very beginning is that jesus didn't actually speak in pa in er in UNK and they've lost they've been put in for our convenience and chapter fifteen is not the beginning of a new incident jesus had already been speaking to the people he had been teaching them in chapter fourteen
er he had been in verse twenty five now great UNK were going along with him and he turned to them and said to them and you got there what he tell what he says he's talking about UNK and of the importance of following him and the cost that will be involved in following him and the responsibility of those who follow him that they are to be salt within their generation within their environment
and then he concludes what we have as verse thirty five he who has ears to hear let him hear
and jesus hadn't stopped speaking but even as he's saying that the these people are gathering around him the tax UNK the sinners the UNK of society they're gathering around him to hear what he's got to say
and as we're gathering around and as jesus is teaching the people there are also coming around er bu being careful not to get too close to the tax UNK and the sinners
there are the UNK and the UNK and they began UNK saying this man receives sinners and eats with them and jesus told them a parable
he is speaking to the UNK to the UNK
he is speaking in response to their UNK
they're UNK that jesus is mixing with sinners
they're UNK that jesus is in the company of sinners
and you know there are a lot of christians today who are just like that
they will mix with sinners on their terms it's alright to speak to them providing you come to my church i'll speak with you
but what about up there where they really are
that's where jesus went
you know jesus didn't spend his days he went to the UNK it was his custom but he didn't spend his days and nights in the UNK he went to the parties
and if jesus was around today he would be going to the places that you and i would think twice about going to not because he wanted to have a good time but because he wanted to relate to the people who were there
he has i haven't come to call the righteous but sinners to UNK
and one of the UNK that was UNK against jesus again and again is that this man eats and drinks with sinners
he goes to their parties
he's to be seen in their company
and these religious leaders didn't like it
and there are a lot of religious folk today who don't like it who get UNK and who think it shouldn't be
it's alright dealing with sinners but you must deal with them on your terms and in on your home ground
well jesus didn't act like that he went to where the sinners were and he mixed with them
and these people who are UNK and UNK at jesus turns to them and he speaks this parable
in understanding the UNK and the UNK of jesus one of the things we've got to do is to say well what do the various things in the UNK what do they represent
after all jesus wasn't just telling them a nice story
now there are times when jesus actually sat down with his disciples afterwards and explained to them what the parable was about and there was a reason for that it was because simply the folk would not have understood it
jesus was speaking to them in a in a concealed language it was only for his disciples and whilst all the people heard it they didn't understand it the disciples didn't understand it and jesus afterwards explained to his followers what he was saying
but there are some UNK that jesus ac explained for the simple reason he didn't have to explain them
the folk would have understood
they would have caught the pictures he was using
they would have seen how it applied
that's why sometimes they got mad at him because they knew he was talking to them and about them and they knew that it applied to them
and this is one of those incidents
jesus then he's talked to the UNK and the UNK
well what do the different components
what are the different things in this parable mean
what do they represent
one of the other things of course we've got to always bear in mind when we UNK try to understand the UNK of jesus is that you cannot and jesus never meant for us to find us u our you know a parallel for every single little detail the for the colour of this or the colour of that or th the shape of something else he didn't expect us and didn't mean for us to find out a pa a parallel a meaning for every single detail because otherwise you're gonna be UNK yourself again and again but what we must see is what is the main basic truth that jesus is teaching here
and in the vast majority if not in all the UNK certainly in ninety nine percent of them jesus is not teaching a multitude of different things he's teaching one basic truth and everything else is just to su UNK and to provide illustration for that
well i suppose the very first thing we've gotta ask is just who or what are these ninety nine sheep
now the common understanding of this is that they're christians these are those who are followers of jesus they're the christians and jesus comes and er ee er there's the little there's the one who is wandering away who's a stray and jesus goes after them and brings them back into the fold and so on
and you know the songs th that we sing around this the song about there were ninety and nine that safety lay in shelter of the fold and so on
but let's look carefully what jesus actually said here
though you know there's a sense in which we can use we we're a we gave it in you to have a certain amount of license and we can use illustrations just as we would use modern illustrations to describe spiritual UNK and to use them to illustrate the gospel
but what actually was jesus really saying here
notice what it says in verse four what man among you if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness
in the open UNK
he leaves them in the open UNK says jesus he leaves them in the wilderness and goes after the one which is lost until he finds it
so jesus doesn't leave them in the fold
he doesn't bring them safely home and you know have them all UNK ti er closed in for the night in safety and security he leaves them in the wilderness
notice what we said earlier on in that last verse the last phrase of the last verse in the previous chapter he who has ears to hear let him hear
who is jesus speaking to
he is speaking to the UNK and UNK
and boy
they got this
it hit them
it hit them right where it hurt
they knew what jesus was saying
you see they weren't sinners they were good righteous religious people there was nothing wrong with them
it was all the others who were sinners
it was the tax UNK it was the pe it was the UNK it was the UNK it was all the others who were sinners not them
they after all they went to the UNK details
they used to even UNK of the UNK in their UNK garden
so they wouldn't fail to keep the law in one bit
and jesus says you keep the UNK things
you ti you UNK of your UNK and your UNK and your UNK yo you UNK of these things when you when you go and pick ten UNK you give one UNK to th to god you UNK of that but you've left the UNK things UNK
you haven't done the important things
you've been UNK at UNK jesus said and yet you've allowed the big issues to go by without UNK with them
they weren't sinners in their own eyes because they did all these little things
and because they did not consider themselves sinners therefore in their own understanding they were not lost
notice what jesus says in verse seven he says i tell you in the same way there'll be more joy in heaven over one sinner who UNK than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no UNK
now what on earth does jesus mean here
righteous people who need no UNK
we all need to UNK
the bible says there is none righteous
know not one
so what on earth is jesus meaning here when he talks about righteous people not needing to UNK
well simply jesus is being rather UNK to them
he's using UNK
he's being a bit UNK
what he's saying is you UNK you don't think you need to UNK
well there is more joy in heaven over the person the sinner who knows their UNK and who UNK you ninety and nine who think you're good enough who don't need to UNK
oh they were lost alright
the problem was they didn't realize it
they were out of the wilderness
they were not safe they were not secure but the tragedy was they are in their little group in their self contained unit with all the other ninety eight UNK around they didn't realize they were lost
they didn't realize they were in danger
they didn't realize they were still in the wilderness
and that one that had UNK off from the rest it became aware that it was lost
what does that word lost mean
now we can use the word lost in a UNK a number of ways
but very simply what it really means let me give you an illustration
you're walking along the road and you have a pound coin in your hand and you drop it rolls along the UNK erm harlow drains are not quite like the drains we used have in london
but it rolls along the UNK and it drops down through the UNK of a drain
now you know anything about drains i've never been down them but if you kno if you know anything about them it goes down about three four foot five foot sometimes and then there is a the pipe the there's a UNK there and then going on down into the in into the main drains
now you can see that coin down there if you look carefully you can see it you can't get it you know where it is it hasn't gone through a hole into the centre of the earth it hasn't sort of disappeared into outer space you know exactly where it is the chances are you could pin point it within a few inches of where i even if you can't see it you know where it is but you can't get at it to you it's lost you know it's UNK location you know when it went there you know everything about it you only thing is you can't get at it
now what does that mean
it means that you cannot use it for what it was intended
cos after all a coin was a had a monetary value that meant you could go and buy something with it
i it was it was a co it was it was currency as far as you were concerned you could use it had purchasing power
now in a sense it hasn't changed it's form one little bit it is still a pound it is still currency it still has purchasing power the only problem is it's just out of your reach and you can't get at it
so to you it is lost
but in itself it hasn't changed one little bit
it is so what it means when it's lost is it is not able to fulfil the function for which it was made
you see pound coins were not made to rest in drains they were meant to circulate they were meant to be used they were meant as a means of currency and that's what the bible means when it talks about being lost
it's not lost geographically being lost you know where you are you know when you're you know you know your situation in time in space i in UNK location you know what you're doing and all the rest of it when the bible uses the word lost it means lost for the purpose for which god intended it
for which god intended you
for which god intended me
that is to be hi for it to be his to be to his praise to be for his glory
when we are lost we are not fulfilling that function
and one of the problems that these folk had and one of the problems we all have is as long as we think we're all right then we're all wrong
UNK is dangerous
it's dangerous for the non christian
you see this really this parable i is the story of something which is lost almost by default it just UNK off it just goes it's own way it didn't set out to be lost it didn't choose you know that i it didn't go through earlier on in that day in the little brain that the sheep has there wasn't the thought going i am going to deliberately get lost today
i'm gonna go my own way i'm a UNK and i am gonna go UNK
i'm gonna give the shepherd a rough time of it
he didn't think that way at all
it just as is the want of sheep it just UNK away from one UNK of grass to another losing all sense of time and direction until it was lost
and so and that can be the ca the same with us
you know there are different ways that we are lost
sometimes it just without even realizing it just that wandering away
but all when we are lost the danger that UNK of not realizing we're lost we're alright
i know i'm i know where i am
i know what i'm doing
i know all about it
i'm okay thanks very much
and all the time we're not alright
we're lost
but you know that is a danger not just for those who are lost as far as god's salvation is concerned there is a danger there for you and i as christians of being UNK of being self satisfied i'm alright
doesn't the apostle say he that UNK his stand take UNK fall
cos we only stand in him
and we're only secure in him
we're only strong in him
paul says i know that in me that is in my flesh UNK no good thing
a danger of UNK
now the ninety nine they did not realize they were lost and yet they were
and the one lost UNK he became the saved one because it was made aware that is was lost
there came a moment in it's experience when it realized it was where it shouldn't be
when it realized it didn't have UNK it's mates around him
when he was isolated and UNK and it was didn't know how to get out of it he was in a jam
now what's jesus saying
he's saying that every one of us we are the sheep
he uses that picture again and again in the bible of us being like sheep
the moment we admit our need the moment we come the realization i'm lost i can't help myself that's the moment that we can be helped
you remember peter when he was er totally different context but the lesson is the same when he was when jesus called him to walk on the water and he starts walking and then he looks around and for what e for whatever reason he starts UNK the moment he calls out help jesus reaches out and UNK him back him UNK him
the moment we realize our need and cry out that is the moment that god is able to respond
that is the moment that the shepherd comes to our rescue and UNK us
then you know it might be a nice little picture but it's no compliment to be UNK to sheep
you know we it might be alright to be a nice to be UNK to nice little UNK and all the rest of it but to be UNK to a sheep is not a compliment it's a bit of an insult because there's no more UNK stupid UNK god ever created than sheep
they are about the most UNK creatures available
you know a dog when it's confronted with danger it can it can fight it's way out a cat will do the same every other UNK will do something when it's confronted with danger a se a sheep is so intelligent and is so strong and is has such a er a self preservation er
awareness that it just stands and UNK and does nothing because it can do nothing
it has got not power or strength of itself
there are the there can be few more UNK creatures than sheep
so it's not exactly a compliment to be UNK to a sheep
it's to be UNK to something that's UNK that can do nothing
well of course it's not er by chance the bible and god uses that picture because we're we are just like sheep in that sense we can't do anything for ourselves
listen what paul says when he writes to the romans in chapter five he says for why we were still UNK at the right time christ died for the UNK
and two verses later on in verse eight but god demonstrates his own love UNK us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
we cannot save ourselves
we cannot rescue ourselves
but in our UNK in our sheep like condition the shepherd comes and he UNK us
and he saves us because we can't do it UNK
you know if it was a dog that was lost if it was a cat that was lost if it was even a pigeon that had got lost they've got some UNK device but the sheep hasn't even got that it can't even find it's own way home
and that's just like human beings
lost
without any hope in the world the bible says
unable to do anything for ourselves and then god comes and UNK us in our hop UNK and UNK
back in isaiah chapter fifty three th the old testament prophet he UNK that picture very UNK doesn't he
he says all of us like sheep have gone UNK
each of us has turned to his own way
rescuing that sheep was not an easy task
and just as the shepherd had to go out and look for it and search for it
it di we don't get all the details in the story that jesus tells of here but it's quite certain that it wasn't just a case of wandering along a nice path until he found the sheep and then bringing it home
as we've already heard undoubtedly it was a difficult job it was undoubtedly as a hard a dangerous task in rescuing that sheep
and of course we know that in the spiritual sense the task of jesus in rescuing you and i in rescuing men and women it was not an easy thing
er that same prophet isaiah in the same chapter he says surely our UNK he himself bore and our UNK he carried yet we ourselves UNK him UNK of god and UNK but he was UNK through for our UNK he was UNK for UNK the UNK for our UNK fell upon him
the law and by UNK we are UNK and the lord has caused the UNK of us all to fall on him
in saving in rescuing lost UNK lost you and lost me it was the hardest most difficult most painful job that god could ever do
it was not an easy thing
UNK sin since christ has died UNK sin is easy but it was yet it was the hardest thing that god could do because he could only do it when christ died for us
so the rescue operation was not di an easy one
it was a difficult one
it is the most difficult work go god had undertaken
creating this world and all the millions of UNK and UNK and UNK and all the rest of creation that was child's play compared to UNK you and me
that called that god had exercise it's everything in bringing it about
we've already heard mentioned this morning some verses have been quoted from another old testament prophet UNK who used similar UNK language in UNK chapter thirty four in verse six
let me read those verses again he says my flock UNK through all the mountains and on every high hill and my flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth there was no one to search or seek for them
oh th the lost condition
but there is th there is the promise in down in verse eleven for thus says the lord god behold i myself will search for my sheep and seek them out
god did not give the job he could not and he did not try to give the job to anybody else
he himself came the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
i myself will search for my UNK for my sheep and will seek them out
in verse erm thirteen i will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them into their own land
i will feed them on the mountains of israel by the UNK and in all the UNK places of the land
i will feed them in good UNK and their UNK ground will be on the mountain heights of israel there they will lie down in good UNK ground and they will feed in rich UNK on the mountains of israel
i will feed my flock and i will lead them to rest UNK the lord god
and david in that UNK which we read earlier in UNK twenty three he UNK the picture of how the good shepherd not only seeks out the lost sheep but once he has brought him back once he has rescued the a lost sheep he care for it
he doesn't leave that sheep that he's rescued in the wilderness but he brings that one safely home as jesus says on his shoulder UNK and he leads it by as david says the still waters and by those green and UNK and UNK
isaiah back in fifty three again tells us what the result will be in verse twelve
no it's not in verse twelve
it's in verse eleven as a result of the UNK of his soul he will see it and be satisfied he'll be satisfied with the rescue operation he'll be satisfied with what he has UNK isaiah says and jesus uses perhaps even more UNK language there in luke fifteen when he says in verse six in verse mm in verse seven when he comes home with that sheep that he's rescued with that lost to but it now has been found when he brings it home he says there wi he says he calls together his friends and his neighbours saying to them rejoice with me
for i have found my sheep which was lost
i tell you in the same way there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that UNK
the rescue operation brings about joy
not only joy to the sheep that's been rescued but it brings joy in heaven
christ himself is satisfied as isaiah says
he comes home UNK
and jesus speaking to these UNK and the UNK he's pointing the finger says you can i UNK and perhaps use well no jesus used some pretty strong language against these people
he called them white UNK full of dead UNK bones but looking nice on the outside
graves
and he saying you miserable bunch of people
you are so wrapped up in yourself
you are so UNK and UNK
you don't realize that you are lost
and i can do nothing for you because i've come to rescue and seek that which is lost and which is aware of it
i'm come to seek and to save the lost
and you don't realize that you are lost and not only that but you are UNK when those who realize their condition call out to me and i'm reaching to them and rescuing them you are UNK at that
that's what jesus is saying in this parable
let me just close with some words from matthew chapter nine in verse ten he said that it happened that as jesus was UNK at the table in the house behold many tax UNK and sinners came and were dining with jesus and his disciples and when the UNK saw this they said to his disciples why is your teacher eating with the tax UNK and sinners
but when jesus heard this he said is it not those who are healthy who need a UNK it is not those who are healthy who need a UNK but those who are sick
that's it
it's those who are sick
but go and learn what this means
i desire compassion and not sacrifice for i did not come to call the righteous but sinners
jesus is not suggesting there are some who are righteous and some who are sinners because we're all sinners all have UNK but he's suggesting that those who don't realize and acknowledge they're sinners he says i haven't come to call you
i've nothing for you
but those who recognize their need they're the ones that i have come to call
they're the ones that i have come to rescue
they're the ones that i have come to find and to bring home UNK and full of UNK
causes even heaven to rejoice when they see those who are lost UNK their UNK and responding and being found
well we're gonna sing now
we're gonna sing from the redemption UNK and it's number three hundred and seventy six
three hundred and seventy six in the redemption UNK and whilst we're singing this we're gonna be taking up our morning offering
i'm not ashamed to own my lord or to defend his cause maintain the honour of his word the glory of his cross
at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away it was there by faith i receive my sight and now i am happy all the day
three hundred and seventy six
let's stand to sing this shall we
this too they left until the end of the meeting in er in part two
part two
sure do you mean paper b or do you mean the whole of item three
the whole of item three the whole of item three
you agree
agreed
there is a problem with magistrates courts and things like that chairman and i don't think there's contention about that is there
they are there are in parts
we make it
are they
as i understand it chair what you're saying is that there are at three there is a request for an exclusion of press UNK but the convenience of press photography we're saying that instead of taking immediately so that we'd have to call them back here for the even later we're asking you for it to be taken at the end with the rest of exclusion
that's correct
but chairman that refers to item three two not the whole of three
yes but i mean it is erm
three wild UNK presumably so that i would assume mr chairman if we do have to maybe you'll be sure that he the with three two agreement
yes
three two yes it's only three two
the others don't come under those sections
it's difficult for me yes
okay you agree
three two
yes
on the budget
and three
on the
no
yes there seems to be some database with what we're
we can't
we can't we can't take c before b really we'd have to discuss c before b we can come back into public on c if you so desire at the end mr
but b will be erm
but b three will be in section in three
we're talking about b three captain b three is open to the public press unless count county solicitors propose a good reason why it shouldn't be
but we don't want to discuss that before b do we really
we've got to make a decision on b before we can UNK c
thank you
alright
yes chair th that's right as i understand it there is no reason why c should not be discussed next session indeed it's probably right that it should be but it's a matter for members to decide whether they can UNK do so before considering b
we can go back into public after b if you so desire
yes
are we not allowed to defer b until the end of the meeting
but we can't take c mrs until we've taken b
no oh right i see
i will i will second you that we
agreed yes
we can do three four chairman
we just agreed it
three four
three UNK only for report
three four is only a report
we haven't had the opportunity to decide the recommendations there
so i mean the recommendations are finally complete have you submitted to policy and resources committee
read over
chairman can i ask what your intentions are with the budget chairman and there's great public interest in the budget
is it your intention to enter a statement part erm at the end of the meeting to the press and so on
if the press are here they can safe safely hear the items if they're not here it doesn't matter
they're not here
we'll deal with that when it comes we're to it yet anywhere near
no
er
can i propose we move on to four
yes we'd better just approve the minutes of the meeting process of the last meeting first of all hadn't we lads
i've completely UNK it
yes
agreed
yes
item four trace of deeds
mr
erm i don't really wish to add anything in particular to this if people would like to ask questions then i'm prepared to answer them
the just note there is a short article note on the UNK situation UNK
if anybody wants to expand on that or anything else i'm willing to do so
okay anybody want to question mr on any of the points
what's the feeling about b s e mr chairman UNK our feelings put them down or what
er yes mr chairman nationally it is going down locally we're going along on a UNK erm and in some areas it is actually go the incidence is going up but this is basically like scotland where they haven't got many anyway
so the overall figure is going down and this really reflects the way UNK have occurred in that some areas have a lot early on they're dropping off
we had a quite a number at the middle of the UNK er that continuing erm and some areas have had none they're getting a lot
we will expect to go down
in other words instead of almost doubling year by year last we are about the same we haven't got all the UNK we're about the same as we were the year before give or take a few about say five percent
whereas before we were going up in UNK and UNK
it's slowing down
UNK off locally nationally beginning to down
jim there's a UNK programme on channel four next week where some of the work that we've done on b s e is UNK and my UNK been through it as well
so that's on UNK on channel four next week
can i ask my usual old UNK again chairman
erm if we're not allowing nerve tissue to be used in the UNK of cattle because we suspect that it might be carried in that and therefore being UNK to live er one species to another how is it now we can buy chops with nerve ti tissue in it
UNK at the whole process
you're only buying lamb chops and pork chops with the UNK columns still in
you wouldn't buy beef with the UNK still in
that sounds nasty
so what you're saying is i'm not sure of cutting the process are you
can you say that with satisfaction in your voice
yes
okay any other questions for mr on paper d
okay will you excuse me i'll be back in a mo
if not we'll move on thank you mr
to paper e report by the chief trading standards officer on animal health and welfare
chair erm
yes jennifer
erm on four er again i don't know what pigeon UNK or pigeon er what their views are on this but you see this is another european directive erm there is a risk it says of this disease being UNK it can be UNK and it was shown that racing pigeons could introduce the disease to commercial UNK
erm is there really a danger of this i see that er the a c are supporting the proposal but is it just another sort of euro directive that is going to cause a lot of expense and distress to a lot of people who keep pigeons which is on the whole not a you know i was going to say not a very erm expensive form of sport or entertainment whatever
it can be i know but i mean erm i'm thinking of some of my electorate and i haven't actually had the opportunity to ask them
as long as they don't come home to UNK
yes
i mean can be and might be and er could be
er that isn't very definite is it
no i think it is it's quite a complex situation but there is a disease of p pigeons which is one of these UNK which has occurred in the country and is a disease of pigeons and most pigeon clubs in fact all pigeon clubs now i believe insist that their members UNK their birds
so most birds are UNK
all the birds and do they
yes most are UNK already
now obviously there are people who keep pigeons UNK with clubs it's not compulsory but there's control in
so any other including any other UNK is really not a very great problem
the vaccine is UNK by UNK it's not UNK in so it's just a matter of really UNK the vaccine in
so i don't see this is a great problem for the
thank you very much it's not really
and it's a it's a belt and UNK because if the other form of UNK did come in it would affect the poultry industry
but when we how cow UNK in the county last
ten years ago
eight years ago
eighty four i came about eight years ago nine years ago
it was UNK back to pigeons UNK pigeons though in th at the feeding UNK erm place in liverpool
so what we're saying really or what you're saying is that the costs erm are not very ex not very high and the cost is well worth the erm protection that it er that it gives
it cuts down a er risk which is perhaps not that high in the first place
but it cuts it down
so it's worth the cost
i mean the report does say that pigeon UNK are opposed on grounds of cost
yes i agree with you on that
i accept that's what they're saying tom you see
but we're given information that the cost is not very high
other questions on the er on the report
ch chair can i UNK er can i have consent under five
i think it's UNK that the concerns and the criticisms of the use of open UNK er has still not gone away in spite of what the UNK said
but i think it's to be welcomed that a medical panel will be established
the difficulty is that there also needs to be some work done to evaluate alternatives because clearly there is widespread concern about UNK of er sheep UNK not only in this area but indeed across the country
members may well be aware of some of the actions that the a t c have been taking on this and have been calling on that to actually look at that to list of UNK
indeed i know a number of authorities who're actually considering sending UNK to meet with the minister to discuss the whole issue of sheep dip and er the lack of compulsory in er sheep UNK
and er i would like to propose that this committee together with the national UNK union and country UNK association sends a delegation to london to meet with the minister to discuss these issues and other our concerns
i'll second that mr chairman
any members there want to express any thoughts on the matter
yes it's quite an ideal choice
you've no doubt you'll be paid
the only thing i wanted to ask chairman if somebody can help me
er the information comes out i think er both in the newspapers and er a number of the television and UNK bit UNK about UNK er in sheep UNK
some people are saying that they're deadly dangerous and er we need to wrap up as if you're going into a nuclear zone and er somehow other people say they're vital it depends on what sort of mix you use and how you use it and where you use it
i mean there do we have any do we have a view do does anybody know exactly what it is
that should we be using it shouldn't we be using it
and er if we shouldn't have been using it what's the alternative
because none of us wants to have er the problems that are occurring when you don't put any sheep dip on
the problem is chairman that the UNK products committee are the only ones that can allow that sorry that advise the minister on what UNK should or should not be er used
when we using b h c vaccine in UNK er late seventies early eighties erm that caused problems because we had UNK left in the meat and the french amongst others found it as well so there were there were problems there and the ministry went over to UNK or to UNK they were the only alternative that they'd got at that er time
right
erm the all the arguments for and against organic UNK have been considered this last nine months by the UNK products committee and they've come out with a report i think that UNK no one because it doesn't go either way in that respect at all it's called for more research and erm development in that in that sense
it's difficult as far as the alternatives are concerned is that no alternatives but effectively it's about four times the cost to administer because you can dip a hundred sheep off one of the er packs and it's a smaller pack
so it's far more expensive and it doesn't do anything against fly strike during the summer
so farmers would have to use this against sheep UNK and they've have to use other UNK or UNK against fly strike in the sum summer
so ideally what the industry needs is an alternative that erm is really that kills off the sheep UNK and at the same time er is er UNK protection against other erm things like er fly er strike
the ministry the UNK products committee is now going away and they're going to do even more work on it erm so i honestly don't think that we're going to get much more out of the ministry until UNK products committee have come back and looked at it yet again because the answer that you'll get is that they're already looking at that side of it
so far as compulsory sheep UNK is concerned er there are a number of counties that have put the view that erm it should be made compulsory again
erm in shropshire the m f u are known to be in favour of compulsory UNK there's no difference between us but if we are going down you are going to send a re erm er a joint representation then i think before you agree to send a joint representation then you need to have a meeting with m f u and c l a to make certain that we're all saying the same thing
erm and if we are going to do to do that then i'd suggest as well chairman that we er raise the issue with er a c so that we don't go alone we go with other authorities if that's what members want to er do
but at the present time i mean mr er might have more information but my information was that erm after the v p c reported was that there was just no alternative dip in the UNK future
yes
i know what v p c means but would you all
the UNK products committee
erm yes there is a report in erm the er UNK literature just come out on the use of an injection to control sheep UNK
this is a it's the same as can be used against UNK fly
it seems to be very fairly effective or very effective but not a hundred percent effective as the UNK type and you need to inject
but the obvious advantage of having an injection is you don't have to put the sheep in a bath but the disadvantage is you've got the UNK which last us slightly longer
so you know it's a it's a balance
so as dave says the alternative dip protocol is very expensive but it does leave no residue
the residue one is a problem as well chairman because when we had the sheep UNK campaigns one of the things that we did was to just carry out some very quick rough checks at markets in this county to see whether in fact sheep were being UNK from slaughter sale for the required period
fourteen days
ten depends on the product but fourteen days
ten days fourteen days whatever it might be
and we found that about twenty two percent of the er sheep being entered had been UNK within the period so in other words they'd not been UNK so it's a concern
you'd have to have cons you have to as well as having the UNK controls you'd have to have the controls over marketing as well
yes
can i just come back chair and i recognize obviously there is er further work that's going on with this and support that it does but there is a case with the parliamentary UNK in discipline on this at the moment so on the way in which it's been handled by the ministry
but i think it is important for us to er as an individual authority as well as working with other authorities to actually keep up the pressure on the ministry to let them know that this isn't going to go away and that they've got to come up with some answers which are which are going to try and satisfy people
