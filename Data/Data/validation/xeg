i understand that this was pretty common quite common throughout british railways it took a few years to knit together you know the nationalization and the fact that we were just the same railway after that
you see
the l m s used to be the biggest of the railways you see
and er they thought they were the big cheese you see th those who worked there
but er they were no better than and no worse than the others either
however after about eighteen month at as a yard foreman as i say i was still branch secretary of UNK branch and carrying on as usual er i put in for there were this yard inspectors job wanted at street station
and i applied for that job and i got it
now yard inspector at er street station seemed a there were there were UNK there were only f half a dozen UNK outside the station at street see
outside the platform and er as i said before it was like they only had small trains you know five coaches was the biggest train they had you know
and that was the liverpool
the rest were maybe three or four coaches
because they went from s from street station
to the edinburgh at least the scotland passengers to UNK to connect up to the main glasgow central to liverpool birmingham and there were all these places
and london
so it was quite a simple job and of course as yard inspector at street my job was to see that the s platforms were always when one train left you had to put the other train in to get the UNK to UNK another train into the empty platform you see for the next the next UNK and that and if a train came in from UNK you see you seen that the pilot and phoned the UNK let the pilot into number five dock
but er it was quite a simple job and er i liked it then now and again i used to walk down to the station master's or the station inspector's office you know have a chat with him and get the gen on what was for the weekend working you see
and er they had a UNK a UNK way of working
which the head station inspector was an old chap douglas was his name
dougie we called him
and what dougie said that went for the rest of them
they all UNK after dougie you see
because he was the you know anyway this day i was just standing UNK away to dougie and one of the inspectors says er the monday holiday this would be the friday the previous to the monday
er on monday the edinburgh holiday now er i'll need for the birmingham will we need an extra coach for that
and dougie would say just a minute
and he'd look up a book
and it was with writing in it his UNK writing in it
er oh aye
aye we better have two coaches extra like
instead of three there'd be five you see
and i wondered how he UNK you know how he got this
and i learned after a few weeks that how he got this was there was no weather forecast as we know them now you know on the television
but it'd been a good day last year on the monday holiday and they had needed two coaches you see
so he was taking it for granted or UNK his hand that this monday for this year was going to be another good day
you see
so he'd put two on
if it was only one for the liverpool ex you know one extra for the liverpool you see it'd be the same this year
what an qu UNK way of working
you know
but anyway it seemed to work all right so
and that's how they got their
were there a lot of these er particularly amongst the older men and the and the inspectors and that kind of thing were there a and you've talked about a lot of the old ideas were still
aye
persistent
did you find that so many it took a long time for change to take place
oh aye
aye
you see th at every station every depot on british rail there were always one man thrown up as being the one who knew everything
you see
the leader
everybody looked to this person for guidance see
and that in itself was a form of UNK you know it is it went back to the old days you see
and it was UNK you know at times
when you asked phoned up say from the yard at street and asked an inspector the shift er the man on the shift er what about er tomorrow
saturday
do you not think we'll need another extra coach on the manchester
or something like that
oh er aye jimmy well i'll tell you i'll see dougie when he comes out
you see
and i'll let you know
that was the style of it they couldn't see couldn't make up their own mind
they were afraid to ta but if they'd had that if they'd told me to provide an extra coach for the manchester as i was suggesting dougie would have come out and taken strips off them for you see
i it was a UNK thing but that's what happened
that's what happened not only at street but other places
but more so at the ex UNK
with the ex UNK they took longer to adapt to nationalization i think than the rest of the railway
however er i got quite friendly with a UNK at er street
the signal box was just up er where i was stationed you see
and er there were some great characters among the UNK
but they too were er old fashioned in their way
they were old men of course getting old men you know at the sixty mark
and er oh no this is how we do it here no
no
but er if i would suggest but if you're er letting that train out first you see and
ah no
we don't want to upset the working and
they wouldn't if you suggest anything you suggested anything to UNK the working you're wasting your time wasting your breath
they would go on their own UNK way you see
because that's how they'd done it twenty years ago and that's how they're going to do it till they retire
so it were no good fighting against them i mean they i used to let them please UNK you know and er just because they were quite happy to go along that way
i was gonna ask you that you moved into er more a more UNK capacity when you
aye
moved into the foreman and inspector jobs
er what sort of relationship did you have with the men did you er particularly thinking that you were still for a long time after that the branch secretary of the union as well you know
aye
how did that square up
aye well there was i wasn't aware of any what you'd call transition
you know from the wages grade to the UNK grade you see
i wasn't aware of that
that said i got to know my men my staff and everybody of course has their UNK you know the different UNK
and i put myself out to find out what they liked best
and what they liked their job how they liked their job
and what part of their jobs they liked best you see
and it was surprising how they responded and i used to cater for their UNK and wishes you know
as long as they were doing what they were expected to do you see
but for instance say we had two UNK i had two UNK
one liked UNK up coaches you see and then the UNK the UNK joining the coaches together for passengers to walk through
see
if one of them i found loved he was an expert as he said at UNK
see
and the other one thought he was good at the UNK
you see
he knew all about it
because i had taught him about it you know from coming from
and i would say to him look joe you know what to do with the UNK i say you go across to the yard and get them ready set them you see
and you you're good at the UNK the UNK you know UNK like
i says you get them coupled up and i can rely on you to get them right you see
well that's how i played my UNK
now i found that i got results that way
and i could rely on them because they were good at that job you see particular job
and i used to tell them they were good at it
and that satisfied them and it satisfied me
and i got on UNK with them
the same with the UNK i would go up to the UNK and tell him well on the other shift you know they would have left that train away first before they left that other one in you see
ah but no not on my shift
my shift we do it this way
you see
and you got to know all these things you got to know the UNK of what they liked best doing you see and everything like that
so that was my way of working with the staff
i didn't oppose them in any way you see
i was getting the best out of them
because what they were doing was their best
you see
and that satisfied me
they were never any hassle
on my shift you know
and i just don't know
do you think it was important that er or do you think your experience coming though the was important
oh invaluable
that was aye
you see coming right up from coal boy and lamp man you know UNK and parcel UNK leaving parcel UNK yard foreman and then UNK guard foreman
i mean it was invaluable you were learning everything there was to know you know
it was a i was gonna ask you know wh when you moved from UNK to foreman you had responsibilities for a lot a lot besides the UNK
mm
but as you as you're describing there coming through the grades
yeah
you'd already had some at least some former knowledge of all the other aspects of the railway in any case
aye
you see when i became yard inspector the staff soon got to know that they couldn't kid me they couldn't kid me you see
because i knew their job i'd done their job you see
each one of their jobs i'd done except the carriage cleaning of course but of course that was a straightforward job cleaning UNK
but UNK and all the rest i'd done their job
i'd come up the hard way you see
and i knew the tricks of the trade
so there were no good in the fighting against me
you see
i could tell at a glance whether the job was done or not
in fact i could hear the click of the b UNK
and the ring the bell you see
and i would say i'd maybe be about twenty or thirty yards away from the coach and i'd say to the UNK when he come out that UNK not caught
you'd better go back and UNK the and split it again and set the UNK
the UNK open
i could even tell thirty or forty yards away just by the ring see
if it was caught
if it hadn't caught it was a dull sound you see a UNK
whereas if it caught there were a UNK a ring you see
so these wee things i knew and er my staff soon found you see that well they just had to go along and do the job as it should be done you see and they were no good at kidding me that it had been done for i used to examine everything that was done you see
if i gave them an order to couple up a full line of maybe ten coaches i wouldn't take it for granted that they'd done it i'd walk up the coach one walk up one side down the other side and i wouldn't if there were a heating valve not open if they forgot that you see i wouldn't do it for them i would go back and i'd say that s k third from the back end the heating valve is not pulled down you've missed it you'd better when you're up that way just pull it down you see
so that was if i'd done it you see that was UNK them
so it was the likes of that and these things that got me to know my staff and got my staff to know me
and there were no UNK
building a relationship with your
building a relationship that's right
and there were never any cause for arguments or never any rows or arguments and that and no shouting and bullying and er no that started at er at er street as a yard inspector
and er well i was there for eighteen month as a yard inspector
and i enjoyed it was quite good i got on well with the staff
and er then there was a vacancy that was a class three inspector's job at yard inspector's job at street
so the inspectors were actually graded as well
graded
they were er a grade five that was the lowest inspector grade four but eventually the grade er five and four were done away with
but anyway that was a grade three i was in
and there was a grade three carriage cleaning inspector advertised for
so i thought i'd put in for that it was a UNK move you know but still it was getting back to my depot and nearer my home
so i put in for that and i got that
and er well the carriage cleaning well a carriage cleaning inspector you just looked after the carriage cleaners and seen that the coaches were right you know and walk along the and examine the coaches after they'd been cleaned you see
and if they weren't properly done you'd tell the UNK that wasn't in such and such a coach in UNK was needing under the seats were needing cleaning
she would tear into her staff you see and get it and then er an along the corridors you know there's UNK up above the doors as they slide into each UNK
and i used to go along with a well a finger you see and that's not been UNK you see
and er just tell the UNK
that was it
but you were responsible
you see when the trains arrive from at UNK and heard that er one superintendent and gerald was his name he was a great boy for going down to UNK to meet trains coming from
maybe once a month at that you know and occasionally just to catch to see if the trains were properly cleaned you see
and he used to take his white UNK out and go along the corridors and above these up on these UNK with his white UNK
imagine a white UNK
and go along with it
and if it was dirty he would go back to his office and phone and phone the yard master and say so and so coach dirty
i've been i've been intending to ask you actually about the about the women workers
er you you've mentioned them off and on quite a few times er that there
mm
that it was predominantly women that were in the carriage cleaners
yes
er how did you find them as workers e in given that there weren't many women at that time er in
well
a manual working environment if you like
at aye and even at there was one woman in charge of them
there was a woman in charge of the women workers
they called her a UNK you see
and most of the UNK see there were one on each shift three shifts and then there were f a middle shift a nine to five shift that was four UNK
now the carriage cleaning inspector had a good job if he went about it the proper way
now i never if i was going through a train or going down a platform and there were two or three carriage women carriage cleaners you know i wouldn't speak to them about their work
i'd maybe have a chat with them you know personal like
but i wouldn't talk to them about their work
i went to the UNK you see
and i told her what was wrong or what wasn't right you see and what w what was wanted what i wanted done you see
and that put her in her place you see and it gave her a position
and she in of course in turn she could get UNK into the women if they missed anything see
not me that wasn't my job i thought
my job my contact was the UNK you see
so therefore there were never any hassle or arguments and the UNK got her place i gave her a place you see
and she in turn UNK her own women staff you see
so it was as simple as that
is er the fact that carriage cleaning was probably considered a low grade i think you'd have felt it was
aye
was there any feeling amongst the men that er it was not only a low grade but it was done by women if you if you like
no you see the women cleaners done the interior of the coaches and the male carriage cleaners did the UNK the UNK you see
with the x mover that's what they called the solution
they just put it on you see with a brush and it was a UNK you see all over the coach and then they had a hose and they washed all that x mover off you see the x mover was an acid and it ate into the you see UNK
and they so that was the men's job was the UNK of the coaches
and the woman done the interior
so there were all there were a distinction you see between men and that
that's what i'm getting at you know what
aye
was the relationship like between the men and women er the men and women cleaners even
ah there were no bother with them
there were no bother they just they were a men er a male carriage cleaner and the women were women
that's not my job as it were
they knew their jobs you see
that's a man's job the woman would say
and the men would say oh that's not my job that's your job
so there were a distinction in that respect and there were never any trouble
and there were never any UNK that i had that i can remember between men and women or anything like that
there were UNK and UNK and UNK with women UNK each other you know
UNK each other 's hair but of course the UNK would come on the scene and she would settle it
i'll just let it run on
something i maybe should ask you about before you start
yes
were you born
i was born at UNK
at the back of UNK the houses were called the UNK
the UNK
mhm
yeah
born in nineteen twenty
mhm
and that's a farm was it that you were born in
well er my father worked at the farm UNK
mhm
that was where he worked
and did you move around when
no
no
and he did the fishing too
the fishing and worked on the farm and
mhm
at nights they the UNK fishing
and UNK
white fish
was it always at night they went
at night after they were finished with their work on the farm in the daytime
mm
and we're going to hear this
yes just start any time
will i will i just go ahead and aye
and is my voice is that will that be
aha
yeah that's i'll just have a look on that check the label
that's fine
looking back to nineteen thirty five brings back memories to us older generation of the splendid UNK when the herring fishing was UNK in stronsay
no UNK sight was ever seen than the herring UNK coming in with their catch of herring on a calm sea in the mornings
the horse drawn lorries going to the different UNK stations where the UNK girls stood at the far end dressed in their UNK ready to start the day's work
no UNK there believe me and to walk past them would be to hear them singing while you work
their UNK knives flashing in time to the music
when i was about ten years old a trip to the village from the south end was a bigger UNK than a trip to a big city would be to a present day child later working in the village as a UNK the dances every saturday and monday night was enjoyment never to be forgot
two of the UNK family from rose cottage provided music with piano and UNK
no UNK in those days but the old cinema rang from end to end with everyone in UNK mood
there were three ice cream shops and a chip shop doing UNK trade all the time
most of us UNK remember mr going his rounds with his ice cream barrel UNK his UNK to be the best in the world and no summer was complete without him
on sunday night a visit to sister 's rest hut to join in the hymn singing was the highlight of the week
with a small UNK providing the lead it really was magnificent harmony
sister will always be remembered for her words you must be cruel to be kind
this was when she had held a UNK finger in a bowl of very hot water but she always got good results
at the close of the fishing season the fishing folks always sang as the boat left the stronsay pier and to hear the song we're no away to UNK a while always brings back memories
stronsay fish UNK in the fishing time was really a busy place with the salesmen busy selling the herring to the UNK stations
this is only looking back close on fifty years
to look to look back further to the sailing boats no doubt would be to recall an even UNK village
mhm
it would have been
yes
the cinema was at the back of the present hotel
it was built first to show pictures then turned into a dance hall
musicians in nineteen thirty five was mrs north cliff the piano and her brother UNK on UNK
m c was late danny
the small water boats ran between UNK and stronsay UNK people across
i have seen them leaving stronsay after a dance and you would still have heard them singing when they reached UNK
UNK was a church of scotland rest hut and there was a english church beside UNK
that church blew down in the nineteen thirty two UNK
that right
mhm
that's right
there was also a gut factory where the herring UNK was made into fish meal
that was in the field as you turn at the UNK of the UNK
the UNK are still in UNK field
usually through the summer we got a visit from the kirkwall city pipe band and they marched up and down the village playing usually followed by a crowd of UNK
twice i can remember the kirkwall brass brand pray playing in the cinema and twice i remember a circus visiting
but that was further back in nineteen twenty seven and twenty eight
i did
mhm
no wild animals just ponies UNK and dogs but it was great UNK seeing a girl in green UNK and a UNK skirt standing on a UNK back while it UNK round the ring
i tried that later myself but fell off
yeah green UNK
that was something that stuck in my mind mm
that stuck in your mind
i can remember at least six of the stronsay women UNK the herring at that time and they stood on UNK beach
there were three in a crew two to gut and one to pack the herring in the barrels
the UNK came in to both UNK and on a saturday night the village was a busy place
the coal boats lay out where the old barge is now and the UNK went alongside them to get coal
the coal boats were UNK by locals and the late j used to work there every summer
needless to say there was plenty tricks played on each other and once when the summer was finished jimmy couldn't get his trunk to move
some UNK had it UNK to the floor
usually UNK and whitehall supplied the four wheel lorries but lots of farmers from up the UNK supplied carts
mhm
big stock boats came from russia and germany for the UNK herring and it was a busy time when they were loading
it was dangerous on the roads for UNK as usually the horses with running with the carts
stronsay hotel was a lovely house with nine bedrooms a big public bar and a smaller lounge bar
there was a large hole hall at the back with a bar
all this was required on a saturday night
i have seen the UNK before the village entirely filled up with men sitting there discussing the week's fishing
on a saturdays afternoon they all set out and walked up past UNK and along to the mill road and the back to the village along the sand
they were all dressed in black knitted UNK and dark trousers
mhm
the UNK were usually done in UNK patterns
the hotel was burnt to the ground in august nineteen thirty nine
and what the other bit of information you got any odd UNK of information you've got written down there
when
mhm just
when you were speaking of the UNK there were five UNK there
mhm
there was david erm from UNK jimmy from UNK duncan a UNK barge and there a fifth one but i'm not right sure of that
for me my husband john UNK was on that UNK the whole time
and they had three UNK of coal in the summertime every week
they had three UNK of coal
between two and three hundred tonnes every time
mm
and they start on a monday and they had it finished by tuesday and then they start on wednesday and thursday and then they went on friday and saturday
and that was the finish
it was most of them was local men but a lot of the UNK men and used to come too and help out
and the UNK men on 's boat
was there a lot of people who came to work here in the fishing town
yes they came for the other islands
the west coast and that but there were folk
oh yes they came from UNK and the kirkwall and
and then the came from UNK
and they came from UNK and sanday and UNK and all that places to help out
work on the coal boats and just different things like that
they were on the boats too
and there's the last cooper see they'd got UNK
there were six there was eighteen crews on UNK with three in each crew
and the last copper died two weeks ago
eric
and he was the last cooper
that stronsay that was left on that worked on UNK
eric
and he gave me that information that there were eighteen crews
just in the one UNK station
on that this UNK station here
mhm
so that gives you an idea there was seventeen stations in stronsay five in UNK well you see
and that was
and then there was all the UNK
how many is that
UNK stations
is that the names of the different UNK stations
that's the names of them
well UNK was the lower no the UNK the one of the bottom of the station was bert and he married a stronsay woman
a
was he a stronsay man
no
he was from er east coast and he married er UNK from
he married her and they had the one down at the lifeboat slip
and then there was UNK one there
you see that house down there
yes
well that was that was my house
oh
that white house
that's the only fishing hut that's standing in it's original position
and that was UNK fishing hut
UNK house
and it's glen it was we UNK it to UNK
and it's the only house now well i left it i left it five year ago but it still belongs to my son
and there was that was UNK and then there was 's right behind it
's was right behind UNK
and then at this side there was erm 's and then there was UNK
that's it
's up here
and then 's in this corner here was 's
's
and then
and that was 's
aye 's and 's is where the new house
and then they went up to the village and it the first one would been 's and 's
and 's and 's dan 's and 's
up there
's was down here and 's was down here
and then
they were below here you see
and then UNK
and then UNK
er 's was the first one and then it was er 's and 's and then 's and then 's and then 's
that was the five in UNK
and there was in UNK too
yes i know
yes
well
no it was a UNK man that was in it
it was that was in it when first then jimmy jim of whitehall had it
well it was that shop
yes
that shop was taken to kirkwall and it's now UNK in old UNK road
mhm
when the first well aye one night we were speaking about this
how many would there have been there were between five or six thousand people in stronsay in the height of the fishing year
yes that would be right
you see there was eighteen three times eighteen is fifty four
fifty sixty three times eighteen
fifteen four women on 's
maybe there were not that quantity in every one but there would have been twelve or fourteen crews on every station
then there was all the UNK
there'd have been ten maybe ten UNK
then
and the UNK were they stronsay folk that worked up at
some of them and they made them leslie and eric and james jimmy and andrew and jim and UNK and jim and them they worked in the wintertime you see and made the barrels
and johnny
made the barrels in the wintertime to have them ready for the summer
yes
tell me about the UNK
told me names of the UNK stations can you mind any of the UNK that were in the village
well the cooper the UNK they would have been one at co 's UNK and then there were one at 's
and that's where the men worked and they just made the barrels in there
so there was just the two
mhm
that i can
mhm
remember here well that was certainly true for the wintertime
yes
but they must have taken an awful lot of barrels away
oh yes the stock boats came just like great stacks see them coming along round
great huge height of all the barrels built up on them
stock boats came on the first day they start coming away in may
yes
and june
and then the UNK there were a lot of UNK here belonging to stronsay
there was sammy and UNK and er from UNK bank UNK and jim they were all UNK and andrew and they were UNK you see a lot of
they worked at that just UNK on the boats
and then when the herring went away they had to load them again
yeah
and er you were speaking about the gut factory
in the wintertime they had a boat they called the UNK and she went to UNK and took UNK from UNK and took to the gut factory here in the wintertime
and my husband john and peter and j their father john
well he was old john
and peter and sandy and they went back and forth all the winter with that boat
and took the UNK and
to the factory to keep the factory going for the factory you see was up in UNK field and there were a lot of stronsay men in it
working in it
and that was something that went on all year
it went on the whole year yes with the UNK and things
you could fairly smell it for far enough
yes
and then the hotel
UNK was mentioning the hotel it's burnt down
well there was in the summertime well there was a cook and a wait a UNK and a maid
and then there was a young girl that would wash dishes and do bits of jobs
yes
that's UNK did you see

yes
and johnny in their boat
and er then there was travellers coming every week
for the they were to begin with in stronsay
yes
and there were travellers coming you see every week for that for that
and then that big h hall at the back of the hotel was a UNK for the travellers to show off their all their stuff
what happened in the wintertime to the shops then when there wasn't so many folk here
did they
well they just struggle on in the wintertime
UNK on
there they are the shops that was the shops

that was the worst sea i ever saw
as the high water mark was half up to what we call the outer UNK at UNK
and the UNK was lying away up the field
also barrels of apples and tobacco and many other useful items that had been part of the UNK cargo were UNK all along the beach
the UNK at UNK was laid flat by the sea but the smaller boats had been pulled up afore that

they tell me that yes
oh yes
mhm
mhm
everybody didn't have orcadian like what they have now
mhm
and as the treasury team meet to discuss spending there's new talk of more defence cuts
a judge at the old bailey has been explaining his full reasons for stopping the trial of the three retired detectives who were accused of UNK with evidence in the case of the birmingham six
mr justice UNK ruled last week that it was impossible for the former officers to receive a fair trial because of the UNK publicity that followed the release of the six two years ago
and the perception generated that the court that freed the six was also finding the detectives guilty
today mr justice UNK stressed that he wasn't suggesting that media coverage of the case should have been restricted
he was concerned simply with the effect of what had happened in this particular case
former detective superintendent george who was in charge of the birmingham pub UNK investigation detective constable UNK and detective sergeant colin were told last week of the UNK view they couldn't get a fair trial
he said when the birmingham six were released in nineteen ninety one it was inevitable the court of UNK decision would appear to be a finding of UNK and UNK against the police
they've been accused of UNK an interview with richard one of the birmingham six
while he made no suggestion that news coverage at the time should have been restricted mr justice UNK said the volume and UNK of publicity had a UNK effect
there had also been personal prejudice against the three men who would have been on trial
the former detectives were not at the old bailey today proceedings against them are over
well it would have been very nice if my clients had the opportunity of a fair trial
but of course we couldn't ignore the factors which er were argued in front of the judge and which led the judge to make his ruling
isn't there though a UNK still on the character of the defendants
erm no i don't think so
er i think certainly not among fair minded people
the judge said the men's defence would have involved a re examination of the events of nineteen seventy four
for the past two years the west midlands police have been UNK the birmingham pub UNK the results are soon to be sent to the crown prosecution service
one of the great UNK questions in the case is what that investigation has UNK
mr justice UNK said he'd had the advantage of seeing the material gathered during this further enquiry into the pub UNK
three of the birmingham six were in the public gallery to hear the judgement
they complained about UNK and UNK over the two years since their release
this er new report is just trying to rubbish us again
that is all nothing more and nothing less
we don't know what's in that report and that's one of the reasons why we're calling for an independent enquiry
we want er whatever's in that report to be disclosed so that we're able to address the questions that come up in it
we have absolutely nothing to fear
the men say they're still considering the possibility off civil action against the police and whether to take their case to the european court
neil UNK b c news
this is the second time a court has ruled that press coverage of a controversial case has prevented a fair trial
the taylor sisters who were convicted of murdering alison were freed after the appeal court described coverage of their case as UNK and UNK
both cases raise the question of just how the press should cover this type of crime
today's judgement said it was essentially a political question
four months ago UNK and lisa taylor were cleared on appeal of the murder of alison
partly because media coverage of their original trail could have UNK the jury against
the press coverage was UNK and UNK according to the appeal court
much of it had assumed the two women were guilty
and there had been so much coverage a UNK would have been impossible
in the taylor sisters case the media was judged to have gone beyond what was acceptable unlike coverage of the birmingham six
nevertheless one editor fears today's decision sets a dangerous precedent which could make successful UNK much more difficult in future
if there hadn't been the publicity then the UNK would never have come to light
so if you start saying there can't be any publicity where there's been alleged UNK or where there's controversy er well you're going to get into in into a ludicrous situation in which the media will never be able to discuss a situation of this sort
today's judgement could have an impact on other forthcoming cases
UNK has been reluctant to return to britain partly because he says media coverage of his case makes a fair trial unlikely
the UNK of a planned musical about robert maxwell were told by lawyers acting for his son kevin that their production and other media coverage could prejudice future proceedings
and lawyers for the two UNK of the UNK bombing say a jury in scotland might be influenced by what they call UNK publicity
one can think of a number of cases which are coming before the courts where there's been a lot of publicity and i'm sure that the legal teams involved in those cases will be studying this judgement er and will be considering whether or not those principles can't be applied to their cases
i think once you've let loose a case like this it will be very hard to contain it
earlier this year a jury UNK three ex policemen of UNK evidence against the UNK four
another widely UNK case
on that occasion the judge didn't feel the weight of media coverage had UNK the fairness of the trial
nick UNK b c news
i'm joined from the old bailey now by our legal UNK by our legal affairs UNK
UNK did mr justice UNK explain why it wouldn't be possible to instruct a jury to ignore the publicity and concentrate on the specific charges
well i think he made it clear that no jury could forget what everybody knew er which is of course er the facts that emerged at the time er that the birmingham six were UNK
and he said it was difficult for the jury to UNK the narrow questions that they were going to have to decide which is whether these officers had er UNK notes of an interview with one of the birmingham six from all the information that they had
and he also pointed out that the three detectives were going to claim in their defence that the birmingham six were guilty all along
now they were perfectly entitled to claim this but this was going to confuse the jury and the jury would also be confuse by the fact there was going to be no mention of the fact which everybody was aware of that the men claim that they were beaten up while they were in custody
he spoke of the enormous amount of new material he had seen the judge did th that is
but doesn't appear to have said what part if any that played in his decision
do you find that surprising
well he didn't reveal any of this new material and none of it was revealed in open court
er it's a matter of speculation as to whether it did play any part
i cannot see that it can have because it wasn't actually put to him but he did mention twice in his judgement that he was aware of this new material and as neil UNK said we'll have to wait and see what that is
UNK thank you very much
this year's UNK peace prize has been awarded jointly to the south african president f w de UNK and the a n c leader UNK
the UNK committee said it was given for their work towards a peaceful ending of apartheid and for laying the foundation for a democratic south africa
mr de UNK said he was overwhelmed by the award
and mr UNK said it would make him UNK even harder for peace
the change in south african politics began with the release of UNK
he'd served twenty seven years in jail for advocating the violent UNK of apartheid
but now putting personal UNK aside he threw his enormous influence on the side of peace
take your guns your knives and your and throw them into the sea
his fellow UNK is the man who released him
president f w de UNK had also UNK by UNK the UNK attitudes of his white UNK
the right wing labelled him a UNK
but the president held a referendum and won convincing support from south UNK
today we have closed the book on apartheid and that chapter
today in UNK news of the UNK prize was celebrated both outside add inside the african national congress headquarters
in accepting it mr UNK president de UNK a demonstration of the mood of reconciliation which won both of them the prize
i UNK this award to all the UNK people of my country black and white who have suffered and UNK so much and UNK that in whatever time remains to me i will spare no effort to bring peace and freedom and justice for all to south africa
president de UNK his belief that negotiations would settle south UNK future
but said the country was at a crossroads
we still face tremendous challenges there are UNK blocks which must be overcome
we have all sorts of remaining problems but by and large if we look back over the past three four years tremendous progress has been made
death and violence are the UNK to negotiation as south africa UNK forward to elections next year
and critics of the men inside both black and white communities have criticized them for causing UNK
but the UNK prize committee said the prize was not a declaration of UNK
instead looking at the changes which had been achieved they judged that mr UNK and president de UNK had laid the foundations for a new democratic south africa and done so through personal integrity and great political courage

the supreme court in south africa has passed death sentences on two right wing UNK convicted of murdering the south african communist party leader chris UNK
UNK a polish UNK and UNK derby lewis a pro apartheid politician were found guilty yesterday
the judge said the two knew the killing would cause chaos UNK and widespread UNK
UNK in UNK at the very moment crowds outside the supreme court heard that UNK and UNK derby lewis two men driven by cold political UNK to UNK chris UNK had themselves been UNK to death
UNK death was a political UNK it UNK nationwide UNK followed by the biggest murder investigation south africa has seen
UNK widow when she emerged insisted that others must have been involved in a UNK
their sentence doesn't bring my husband back
their sentence doesn't bring the father of my three daughters back
now we are left with getting the UNK
the UNK of my husband's UNK should be brought to court
then we'll have true peace
in court earlier the UNK general said UNK a polish UNK driven by UNK for communism and derby lewis right wing conservative party activist had committed a cold UNK and UNK crime
society he insisted demanded their destruction
the judge agreed
before handing down the death sentence he asked if the two men had anything to say
UNK and derby lewis showing no UNK replied nothing
they were driven away to death row in UNK central prison
for the past three years president de UNK has maintained a UNK on hanging with the a n c's approval
this afternoon UNK gave his UNK
the death sentence is the best sentence a court of law could have imposed under the present circumstances
UNK faces a serious dilemma after appeals it will be his government that must decide whether or not to UNK sentence
if he UNK by a n c policy and spares the lives of UNK and derby lewis then thousands of young UNK in the UNK will be UNK
if the two men hang then south africa faces the very real risk of a severe right wing backlash

here the royal college of UNK and UNK has expressed concern about the safety of UNK births
the college has asked the department of health to investigate the practice after a baby died during delivery in a pool in UNK
this afternoon doctors at a bristol hospital disclosed that a baby there had died after the mother used a pool during the first stage of labour
but the royal college of UNK said it wouldn't use the technique if it didn't believe it was safe
twenty years ago one british birth in ten thousand was UNK today in some areas of the country it's one in twenty
the death of a baby boy this week in UNK has raised fears there about the dangers of birth UNK
he did not breathe UNK and died in a UNK w with lungs filled with water and we can't exclude that the reason for that was just the water bath
the UNK hospital concerned has now closed the bath used for UNK deliveries
doctors at a bristol hospital said today they'd called for more research following two cases there in which mothers had used water baths in the early stages of labour
though in neither case was delivery UNK
one child dies another is brain damaged
this could merely be UNK it could be merely chance
er but since this is a relatively new area of technology we felt it our responsibility to report this
the royal college of UNK and UNK say too little data exists on the dangers of UNK birth
our main concern is here is a method that might be a problem it's theoretically and UNK could be a problem about which we do not know the extent
many mothers sing the UNK of UNK delivery
after two traditional births jayne UNK had her nine week old daughter UNK
it was peaceful it was erm quick it was easy if you can call UNK easy
erm and she had a wonderful peaceful entrance into the world
at one british hospital where UNK delivery was UNK almost three hundred and fifty births have taken place over five years without problems in the special pool
there's enthusiasm for this method of delivery
we wouldn't be offering it if we didn't feel it was a safe option for women
but of course nothing is a hundred percent safe in UNK or the medical profession
but i can't UNK enough we wouldn't be offering it if we didn't feel it was a safe option
the department of health says it will be studying UNK concerns about UNK birth

the chancellor of the exchequer kenneth clarke is meeting senior colleagues to discuss taxation and spending options for next months budget
it's emerged that further cuts in defence spending are being considered including reducing the number of senior officers and ministry of defence civil servants
but the chairman of the defence select committee has warned it would be unrealistic to make any further reductions
of all the ministers present for today's crucial session of future spending and tax plans michael partial the chief secretary to the treasury is said to be most UNK to see further cuts in the military
treasury officials say they want to save one billion pounds on defence the opening demand in a vicious whitehall battle
one treasury suggestion is to cut senior personnel because one estimate shows that junior ranks have taken the UNK of the cuts so far
the m o d says that idea wouldn't save much with all the UNK and pensions and there is support for that view
even if you did cut one or two UNK you're not going to make much of a UNK in a fifty billion pound public expenditure deficit
and so i think that it's easier to make criticisms of small matters in detail but it is not easier to make a serious defence cut
and if we were to cut further in any significant way then we would undermine our capacity to look after the defence interests of our country
with troops UNK in bosnia for a year already and no one knows for how much longer the defence secretary malcolm UNK is openly arguing against more cuts unless commitments like this are cut as well
the opposition and the military agree with him
the government are putting the defence of britain at risk by this treasury led approach
we're asking our troops to do more and more with less and less
what's needed is a full defence review so we can actually shape our forces to match the threats which are facing us
if you're going to keep up the same pattern of commitments the answer is that the army is already stretched as it UNK be and so are the other two services and this is putting a terrific strain on the individual UNK and their families
and i don't think any money can reasonably taken away
the defence ministry may be helped in its battle with the treasury when the commons defence committee UNK two highly critical reports on monday at the start of the annual defence debate
there's also support from the foreign office which wants to see britain contribute to u n operations and from industry which is desperate to secure orders for new weapons
none of this though guarantees the armed forces will be UNK from further cuts

more than a thousand people held a peace rally in belfast today in protest at last UNK murder of a catholic father of five
UNK at the rally said they were UNK by the shooting and by other loyalist attacks on UNK
in a separate development the president of UNK gerry adams called for the UNK of the UNK and repeated that the i r a was not prepared to arrange a UNK cease fire
there have been many peace UNK many times before in northern ireland the significance of today's not the numbers a thousand or so but who they were
workers from UNK and UNK and other companies predominantly UNK demonstrating at the murder of a catholic
they were told now was the time to find the courage to stand up to terrorists
it's quite UNK that ninety percent of the people here were UNK
starting out for a catholic worker
and that to me i is a very positive point
i think over the last few months there's been so much killing that maybe for me that was the UNK
at the same time the UNK president gerry adams said again in a b c interview there would be no UNK cease fire by the i r a and what was needed was total UNK
but he UNK the UNK adams talks were the only window of opportunity around
comments which will be the focus of the UNK unionist conference when it starts tomorrow
a conference which has UNK enormous interest after the party suggested this week they would talk to UNK if the i r a ended its campaign of violence permanently
a position which has UNK many unionists at grass roots level
but as the politicians continue to argue and the UNK continue their own agenda the people are as desperate as ever for some formula which will end the killing

the united states is asking the u n security council to UNK a stop and search operation against ships heading for UNK
an american official said washington wanted to enforce the international oil and arms UNK against the country
the move follows yesterday's UNK of the justice minister in UNK government
bill UNK advisors gathered at the white house to face yet another foreign policy challenge proposing the use of u s naval power to enforce sanctions against UNK and at the united nations u s UNK were pressing for what would be a UNK of the island
UNK military UNK have UNK their UNK at the u s the UNK of pro UNK politicians a deliberate attempt to UNK the return to democracy
we need the military to UNK decided and willing to stop violence
not to look for sophisticated legal arguments while people are being shot and killed in the streets
with canadian peace keepers now pulling out of UNK supporters are asking the u s for protection
a UNK of the er marine UNK at the UNK as a security matter er to potentially provide for other UNK for UNK who may who are in danger
the UNK military have shown no willingness to compromise and washington now wants u n UNK to use military power to enforce sanctions against them
that would mean u s UNK ringing the island and the UNK of a UNK that the white house now seems determined to win

people are drinking less
erm and they're drinking less because of the recession
they're drinking less because of changes in lifestyle
erm and a an awareness er UNK of drink driving laws
since the war there's been the slow death of the british beer UNK
people in the business say we've changed our habits
men tend to drink in rounds less now
peer group pressure is UNK on that
and there's been the wine bar the symbol of the eighties
nineteen seventy eight was the peak bitter and UNK year in britain
forty million barrels were produced
today under assault from wine that's fallen to thirty four million two hundred and twenty pints a beer each now nearly three hundred a decade ago
and less heavy industry means less heavy drinking
traditionally after a day in the UNK the coal mines people used to UNK their UNK to replace the UNK they've lost
perhaps six seven pints of beer then
tho those sort of UNK i think have erm almost disappeared in large areas and subsequently beer consumption has fallen
and UNK grows as beer falls
advertised in an UNK style for younger people
and beer caught between the factors and the one third increase in UNK over the past decade
all pressing the UNK and their employees

the princess of wales has been speaking about the problems faced by people caring for loved ones who have suffered brain damage
addressing a conference in london she said that all too often families were left isolated UNK and exhausted as they helped to rebuild a UNK life
two years after a road accident chris UNK is learning to walk again
he's receiving intensive physiotherapy at the UNK medical UNK centre in south west london
which has an international reputation for treating patients with head injuries
but the centre is far from UNK
a third of its beds have been empty for several years
despite a waiting list of patients
the UNK director who organized today's conference attended by the princess of wales says health authorities give too low a priority to UNK head injured patients
he says delays UNK chances of recovery
it's UNK the earlier the patients treatment begins the better
there are physical problems psychological problems all sorts of problems
the needs of the patients aren't me met
let alone the needs of the family and the carers
dr UNK also UNK the lack of UNK for people like UNK
he's a former patient of the UNK and is cared for by his wife a nurse who he met at the centre
UNK is blind and physically disabled he pays for two private physiotherapy sessions a week otherwise his condition could UNK
once you're er out of a hospital that's that
this or that anybody without the private means to pay for it has to do without physiotherapy
the princess of wales who's UNK of the national head injuries association UNK told the conference that adequate resources for UNK were essential
we need to know for certain that if a person were to suffer in this way the care will be there for them
not just at the beginning but throughout what may prove to be a long and difficult journey of recovery
the clear message from the conference was that without adequate facilities many head injured patients will fail to improve and could even get worse

when you were a child or when you started
UNK erm from july thirty nine i think were when i came back and then what led up to me going abroad
oh yes
being a UNK

yes i've got the national society of children's nursery certificates
mm
where did you train
did you have to go to college or
erm i went to as a private nurse i started training in the north UNK then i did children's training in the children's aid society
oh i see so you were erm a trained nurse as well as a children's nurse
yes erm well erm and i belong to the nursery UNK association
mm
and that's where i got this job with
mm
babies
mm
in london
mm
how many erm children did you look after before you
two
just two children mm
erm just two children
because when you were trained in those days you only had two children or otherwise you had another UNK if you had more
oh i see
you had complete charge of the children
mm
what was the first family
well the er family i went to well they were all nice families cos you have you loved your babies cos you had them from birth and you looked after them
and i did return to nurse them for two years
oh yes
with what we called UNK mothers in
mm
those days
mm
and the mothers wouldn't have the children er
mm
once they got erm pregnant
mm
and so the children's aid society which was the church of england society then
oh yes
they erm had this erm had these people in UNK and
mm
we had the girls months before babies were born
oh yes
and er then when they had their babies a lot of them wanted to keep them
mm
and so we had our own homes for the boys in brighton when they were older and the girls at UNK
oh i see
it must've taken quite a bit of courage for the girls to have kept their babies
yes and erm
a real stigma wasn't there UNK mothers
yes in those days there were and they was mostly young girls they were UNK going across the heath or it's their UNK and
oh dear
things like that
they weren't you know they didn't weren't girls that would er in those days know what they're doing so much you know
no
and i used to have to sing UNK for them on the wards they used to love that
mm
and erm then we kept the babies in different UNK homes at
UNK and norwood
oh yes
and then when the boys were of school age they went to brighton and the girls to UNK and
mm
and we kept the homes small about twenty in a home to make it more like home like and not institution
mm
and er then when they if they got UNK they went to other schools
they had their own bathing tent on the beach
oh yes
they used to go swimming and walks in the winter have their friends in for tea
mm
and er then when they left school some were UNK and some were nurses
oh i see
cos in those days some of the homes just pushed them into domestic service and that kind of thing
at least you know they had more UNK more care for the
yes
children they weren't really sort of UNK out were they
yeah and we you know having them as from babies you're so attached
oh yes that's
to these children
right yes
and er

er erm the one i applied erm through the nursing mirror for that one
when i was er i started at the north mid but i was only there a few months
mm
and i wasn't too happy and that's why i saw this job advertised
mm
and i went there and worked with the UNK and er and then i worked in the maternity side of it
mm
and i loved the new babies
oh yes
and i used to do testing you know for urine
mm
and things
mm
er one night keep in touch with the mothers mm
mm
and we were with them all the while
mm
and it was really a happy life i enjoyed that and then when they we found them all jobs
really
er once they were able to leave the home and so that everyone was looked after they never left our care really and
no
and whenever they wanted to go to see their children they could
they either went to UNK or brighton wherever it was necessary
that was marvellous really it
yeah
could have turned out so differently couldn't it
yes and then er i wanted to change and i wanted to do private nursing
mm
so i went up to UNK and did voluntary work in the maternity home
mm
until i got fixed up with a private job
mm
and that was a jewish family
oh yes
was that in london
and it was yes in london
mm
er UNK green

mm
and er the children used to play on the banks of the UNK early in the morning when they got up there was all sand there
oh yeah

cos we used to tie up we weren't on the water at nighttime
mm where did you stay
did you sleep on the boat
you didn't
we slept on the boat
mm
and erm that we didn't go on trek for so very long
no
about a week i suppose
mm was this quite often during the year or was it just the once
er that was just the once while we were there
i see
cos it was only supposed to be six months that we were there
oh yes
and then we came went back to UNK
mm
erm i mean we were in UNK but er just at this week's trek
yes
and we used to go to the cathedral
mm
and the raf lads were there and
oh yes
and lots of soldiers but there weren't many english nurses but they're only english you know families out there
mm
so erm how did it did you stay for the full six months or did it er extend further than that
er no
then the italians started to raid us and we had no fighter planes
oh i see so really
and they were dropping their bombs and some on the and they some of the people were killed there
some bombs they dropped on the raf camp
mm
but they didn't UNK so the raf lads said they were made of UNK
and er so mrs said oh we must we must try and get out of UNK cos it was so hot and we'd booked to go to k er for a week
mm
and the night we slept in the garden and the night before we went we mrs was taken ill and i was giving her UNK up and the UNK where she was sleeping in the garden
mm
and she said you'll have to take the children to in the morning cos it's all arranged
mm
so she had a little book and she wrote some words in english and some in UNK the
yes
other side
i see
and er i managed to get the children to this place called
how did you travel there
erm by train
mm
and erm we had we were in little kind of UNK on the UNK
we went up the hotel to meals
mm
and there's all sandy UNK around that the sandy wa sandy UNK that the UNK had made and we used to run down there when there was air raids
they used to ring a bell up at the hotel
i see
and er one day i was bathing judy in the hut and the bell went and i just had to wrap a UNK round her you know and run down to the sandy UNK and things got so bad we went back to UNK
mm
and arranged to go UNK to rhodesia
all the english families went down south
oh yes
some got as far as rhodesia and the high UNK wasn't any good so then they had to go on to UNK town
so but we were able to stay there for a time
how did it affect them then the UNK did it
i think it's the breathing the UNK so thin
yes i suppose if you
and er
had any problems of that UNK then it would UNK you know a UNK it wouldn't it
yes
but you managed it suited you
i managed all right it suited me
mm
and er then mr said it was safe for his wife to return and children that they trouble was they couldn't get a seat for me on the plane
it was a sea plane we were on
oh yes
and er i said i'll join the UNK
oh i see
so that's where
so they returned to UNK and you stayed in rhodesia
so yes so when we went down to rhodesia i er UNK there and i went down i went to UNK
mm
and i think it was the twenty third UNK that they have here
there was over a thousand lads on the camp
mm
and erm i used to do erm keep a check on the flying times of the planes cos every forty hours they had to come in for a different check
mm
and enter up the repairs and UNK
oh that's nice
and train the english lads when they came out for that kind of work
yes
that they had to do there
oh how long were you there
er what in
mm
well most of the war you see
mm
and at the end of the war i got married out
oh aye
when i was out there
oh you married a raf man did you
but he wasn't raf
no
but he worked of on a raf camp
mm
he was exempt because he had a heart an UNK heart
oh i see yes
and erm so that delayed things you know getting back home
mm
so you lived in rhodesia did you
so i lived in rhodesia
this was after the war
after the war
mm
i erm i did go down to UNK
mm
and waited six months to get home that's before i got married
mm
and erm but the plane the er boat was slow in coming and it was so hard to get a ship back then
mm
so i returned to rhodesia and that's when i got married
oh i see
and then when i had my little girl er when she was about a year old
mm
i came back to england
oh did you
and had a holiday
mm
and i stayed with mrs the people i went abroad with
oh yes
for two months
oh
and then i returned to rhodesia again
mm
after being over here about a year
mm
did your husband and daughter come with you
but he was still in rhodesia
oh i see
then in sixty we came ov back to england
mm
and my husband decided he would like to come over then
he wouldn't come before
was he english
but he was UNK he
english yes
he came from UNK
oh yes
he had been in a children's home
oh yes
and he was sent out to rhodesia to rhodesia
oh
and
quite a coincidence your experience of working in a children's home
yes
and your husband having been brought up in one
yes
strange how things work out like that
yeah
so you came back to england in nineteen sixty
er yes and in sixty one er he had lung trouble
mm
and the doctor advised me to take him back to rhodesia
oh aye mm
and er so in nineteen sixty six he died
mm
and erm i was feeling ill at the time and i wondered why because he'd been through so much suffering you know it was a happy release
mm
but i had this UNK coming on and i gr gradually went paralysed
does that at attack the nervous system
it attacks the nervous system
mm
from the UNK
i see
and i went paralysed from my toes and
was it a gradual thing was it
gradually from the toe that was july and i got paralysed up to my hips and er i had no relations or anybody there but UNK h were very good
they used to you know do any little bits of shopping or anything
mm
er that they could but i had
were you still living at home
i was at home then and er i also had two rooms in a private boarding house
mm
and erm i had UNK as well which i'd contracted from jim
oh goodness
and so i could only have UNK or fruit to eat and
mm
so then the UNK phoned up the doctor in october
mm
and said you'd have to get me into hospital cos i couldn't move you know
so it just
the bottom part was all paralysed then
oh goodness
so i was taken to hospital and i was in hospital two years
mm
cos and the UNK up to my shoulders
mm
and the UNK said anyhow you're alright from the shoulders up you
mm
that was cold comfort really
and erm but i never thought it would be a long job
no
but erm so being in hospital two years and then i was in st giles for eighteen months which is like stoke UNK
oh yes
and th we used to be visited by some of their people
mm
and er and mr and mrs came up from UNK
mm
and to st giles and they heard about me and they offered me a month's holiday and they were complete strangers and they gave me a month's holiday
oh
and we were in a flat high up facing the front south beach next door to UNK hospital
mm
and whilst when i was in hospital i always had that feeling that i'd love to hear the water UNK on a beach you know and
oh yes
and it did come true cos when i was in the room there i could hear
you could hear
hear the water UNK and see the UNK on the hospital window UNK opposite
mm
and they were wonderful people they took me all over UNK
the valley of the thousand hills
oh yes
and i visited their friends and went to their church with them and they gave me a wonderful time did everything for me
mm
because i needed you know looking after then
oh of course yes
but i had UNK
yes
and i could get along holding their arms you know one each side
oh i see
so we used to have walks sometimes along the front
oh that was great
mm and there was a UNK there so if i didn't go out you know i could always sit on the UNK and watch them UNK
mm
and so it was a lovely time
it was a really welcome relief wasn't it from you know being in hospital
yes
so then when i got back to erm er st giles erm i was there for a month and then i went into a home for the blind and handicapped
mm
and i was there nine years
mm
you had some movement
and er
returned to you completely paralysed
erm yes erm well at the ti at first i could only move my head but when i went on that holiday st giles had been working on me with nerve machines and muscle machines
mm
and in the swimming in the hot water
mm
used to have a black rubber tyre round my middle
yes
and so i could er you know move around and that's why it was i was able to walk with UNK
mm
i got on fine then
mm
but erm it was diagnosed late you see having UNK for three months that the er the movement was last to come back in the toes and feet
mm
that's with me seeing that it was so long before it was diagnosed that's why my feet and hands are still paralysed
mm
i suppose the real UNK
yes and you think you can move your fingers and you pull on them and you look down and i'm trying to pull them now but they just won't move
must be a strange UNK your brain
yeah
is telling you things but
yeah
it just won't obey
that's what i don't understand because the message is going to the brain to do it and yet i try and i can't
mm
must be obviously some break in you know
yeah
the nerve UNK mustn't there
affect
yeah
your fingers
the toes thank goodness are straight that's why i can get a UNK on
mm
but the fingers are UNK round
mm
considering you know you are so handicapped with your hands
yeah
and the UNK and everything
yeah
the UNK i think is fantastic
you see the st giles taught me to type first of all
mm
with a well they made the wooden stick and i got the UNK book and
mm
i taught myself typing
did you
and er then they UNK
quite a UNK lady aren't you
then they taught me the copper
mm
work they showed me how to do that and i just love copper
mm
and erm and then they tried me on painting
mm
and during this time i belonged to UNK h
mm
i was initiated in fifty six
mm
and they were very good to me and they kept in touch with me
mm
and erm then i couldn't be really active and you're supposed to be an ac active to be a member of a branch
er they said oh we'll find you a job so you are active so i was UNK out there
oh were you oh
and erm then when these jobs came along i was er the handicapped UNK at st giles
mm
my friend said i'll erm i'll only go if you'll come too
and i said how can i like this
well i did that was about nineteen seventy
mm
and erm so we started the UNK and i could train them and we used to have such fun together you know
mm
and er and then those UNK got older and i started the first girl guides there
really
and erm so that in nineteen eighty when things got so bad in UNK
yes
that people were leaving the country my friend wrote to my UNK in one house and asked her if i could live with her until i got fixed up in a home
mm
i thought it would be quicker you see and i'd been in the services as well because i used to give a subscription to british UNK
mm
every year
mm
and they did have bungalows for UNK over here in different parts of england
mm
that erm when i got here you know i knew how difficult it was to get fixed up anywhere
mm
and i had my name down for sue UNK and the UNK and then a vacancy fell due here
yes
and that's why i'm at one house UNK house
house
so that's it's convenient that
does your UNK still live at one house
yes my UNK is at one house
yes
and she comes in to see me on her way home from work
mm
and her house wasn't suitable you know cos of the stairs
yes that's right
and she was just a working girl you know and it was a worry to her as well
mm
so she can visit me now
mm
and erm so that's how my life is
you came here in nineteen eighty did you
nineteen eighty
mm
mm i've been here just on four years now
mm
you certainly keep yourself busy don't you
yes

the UNK school at UNK bridge run by the reverend william
charles and emily followed a couple of months later
UNK was eleven elizabeth nine charlotte eight and emily six
but the reverend was UNK of the children's spirit the food was very poor and the girls were often UNK and cold
well UNK and UNK because
yes
yes
UNK at least
erm i'm sure erm UNK is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation of what it was like at school
UNK developed t b and died at home in eighteen twenty five aged twelve
and elizabeth a month later aged ten
and then their father brought charlotte and emily home for good
the four children invented imaginary countries and characters and threw themselves UNK into it
with branwell and charlotte especially er developing a country called UNK
and emily and anne a country called UNK
in eighteen thirty one charlotte was sent to the to UNK head school at UNK she was at first UNK but eventually carried off three prizes
she left the following year having exhausted all the UNK the school could offer
in eighteen thirty five she returned as a teacher her salary to pay for first UNK and then UNK there
in eighteen thirty seven emily became a UNK and then so did anne and charlotte
in forty one charlotte and emily travelled to brussels to become pupils at the UNK en des occasion pour les UNK er charlotte fell in love with the principal but he didn't UNK
erm and she returned when she returned as a teacher without emily in forty three
and she returned home UNK the following year
er i'm sure you remember about UNK little erm UNK and UNK green and how branwell got into trouble
back home together finally the sisters published their collective poems under the UNK of UNK and UNK bell in eighteen forty six
erm in september eighteen forty eight branwell died of t b aged thirty one
in december emily aged thirty and in may forty nine anne aged twenty nine
charlotte was then left alone with her father
she wrote shirley and UNK
became very well known and a friend of mrs UNK
married her father's UNK against his UNK wishes in eighteen fifty four the reverend arthur bell UNK
UNK in ireland where her husband came from
and died almost certainly of excessive sickness in pregnancy aged thirty nine
er her father lived on for another six years
and UNK returned to his family home in ireland
the professor was published UNK in eighteen fifty seven
i'm sure this is all very familiar territory
UNK lives are almost sort of erm part of british history aren't they
you know
right
erm would anyone like to give us a plot resume in jane eyre
i could read it from the oxford
history of english literature if nobody wants to do it
shall i read it
yes
the UNK a UNK has been left to the care of her aunt mrs reed
harsh and UNK treatment UNK her UNK spirit and a UNK leads to her consignment to UNK institution
there UNK for the UNK of the regime by the UNK of the superintendent miss temple and a fellow UNK helen burns she dies in jane's arms of who dies in jane's arms of consumption she spends her miserable years eventually becoming a teacher
on miss UNK marriage she UNK a post as UNK at UNK hall to UNK the UNK daughter of mr rochester a UNK hero of UNK aspect and UNK temper
rochester despite jane's UNK is UNK by her sharp wit and independence and they fall in love
after much resistance she agrees to marry him
but
on the eve of their wedding her wedding UNK is rent by an UNK who rochester UNK her is a servant grace poole but who is the next day revealed to be his mad UNK wife UNK confined to the upper regions of the hall for years whose UNK presence has long disturbed jane
the marriage ceremony is UNK by mrs UNK brother from the west UNK
and despite UNK full confession and pleadings with jane to stay with him she UNK
after nearly UNK on the UNK she is taken in and cared for by the reverend st john rivers and his sisters mary and diana
it is UNK that they are her cousins and that jane has inherited money from an uncle
the legacy is equally divided between the four
under pressure from UNK appeals and strong personality of the dedicated rivers jane nearly UNK to marry him and share his missionary UNK in india but is prevented by a UNK appeal from rochester
she returns to UNK hall to find the building burned and rochester UNK and UNK from his attempt to save his wife from the flames
she UNK him and in the last chapter we learn that his sight is partially restored
i know it's always the way with plot UNK but there are actually one or two minor mistakes there aren't there
i found one
yes
immediately
well i may say so
yes do
i understood rochester said to jane that he wasn't sure er his french had spent so many
mhm
men that he didn't even know if it was his
that's right
and i had the impression that he just adopted this child through sheer sorrow and sympathy for her but did not say erm UNK that was his
no
he calls her his board
erm
that's right
yes
i mean that could of been er an element of victorian UNK in there
yes
yes
but he does make it plain to jane that he doesn't know
no
yes
if UNK is his daughter
and this one says quite UNK that is was
yes
mm
that's right
also helen burns isn't an UNK if you remember
oh yes
yes
she's actually got a father
yes
yes
mm
erm
and actually er it doesn't it implies that her it's of the UNK but in fact er it improved because they had an UNK of erm UNK didn't they
that's right
yes
i mean
and it er wasn't
th
so bad as she grew older
that's right
i don't think i would say
eight years of misery
no
no
no i
it became UNK didn't it
mm
yes
yes
yeah
and also it implies at the end that erm jane and rochester meet at UNK hall and they don't they meet UNK
his other property if you remember
yes
when er when he goes to live afterwards
yes
i mean i know it's hard it's hard doing erm
yes
and she wasn't going to marry she never really considered UNK rivers did she
it said she was on the verge of marriage
i heard she
she was almost
er
UNK
yeah
by him
she was yes
yeah
you know
she was almost on the verge of just letting her will be UNK into his wasn't she
yes
which would have meant marriage because he would have
but not to marry
insisted
well i think he would have
yeah
insisted
er she didn't want to no
erm
who would
he was such a UNK pig anyway
he was terrible wasn't he
yeah
erm i'm sure you know of this novel anyway but just in case you don't jean UNK er has written wide UNK sea
telling the story as she imagined it of the mad wife
oh
yes
before she came before she knew rochester
yes
and her marriage with rochester
sorry
what was that book
wide UNK sea
wide UNK sea
yes
jean UNK
r h y s
mm
oh
yes
and if you're interested in spin UNK from stories i can think it's
it's a very nice book
it is yes
it gives a it gives an idea of erm what rochester did want
exactly
it put UNK case
yes
doesn't it
mm
yeah
it does
and that one
too
right
erm
do you mean the story in the book before when you were talking about
i don't think it's
that
jean UNK
jean UNK wrote
yeah
a separate novel
oh
telling taking a character out of jane eyre
the UNK wife
the mad wife
yeah
and UNK what her life was like before she married him
erm the novel the second UNK the second edition of the novel was dedicated to william UNK who charlotte UNK tremendously
mm
with a sort of tragic turn of fate she did not know he had a mad wife
erm and er i don't know whether UNK presumably he realized she didn't know
well in the third one she does mention er this explanation was served directly by mistake should been made
ah
right
so possibly she's faced that
yes
erm the no the reception of the novel
it was published in eighteen forty seven in october under the name UNK bell
the second edition was printed two months later and the third the following spring
she achieved popular success at once
and it was claimed as powerful fresh original UNK and UNK
she was UNK by english and french critics as well as the reading public
although some critics termed the novel UNK meaning different things some of them
some meant UNK frank too frank the inappropriate placing of passion in a poor plain girl's mouth
now if that wasn't what charlotte bronte was pleading for i don't know what it was
and that the novel attacked both UNK and the upper classes quite UNK
erm there are a few interesting quotations on the reception of the novel
one or two people who are always worth hearing if you can bear with me
UNK
writing to erm w s williams a friend
i wish you hadn't sent me jane eyre
it interested me so much that i've lost or won if you like the whole day of reading it at the UNK period with the printers i know waiting for copy
who the author can be i can't guess
if a woman she knows her language better than most ladies do or has had a classical education
it is a fine book though
the man and woman capital a style very generous and UNK so to speak
i thought it was UNK for some time
the plot of the story is one with which i am familiar
some of the love UNK made me cry to the UNK of john who came in with the UNK
st john the missionary is a failure i think but a good failure
there are parts excellent
i don't know why i tell you this but that i have been UNK moved and pleased by jane eyre
it is a woman's writing but whose
give my respect and thanks to the author whose novel is the first english one and the french are only UNK now that i have been able to read for many a day
mm
erm the next one comes from the UNK magazine
essentially jane eyre an UNK has some UNK to those UNK of the middle ages in which considerable ability both mechanical and mental was often displayed upon subjects that had no existence in nature
and as far as UNK was concerned were not UNK in themselves
there is indeed none of their literal UNK or UNK
we do not meet the faces of foxes or writers under clerical UNK neither is there anything of physical UNK
but with clear UNK presented a UNK consistency in the characters and their conduct and considerable power in the execution the whole is unnatural and only critically interesting
there is one fault too in jane eyre from which the artists of the middle ages were free too much of UNK
their UNK of their art was too great to UNK them to resort to trick to tell their story
in the fiction UNK by UNK bell there is rather too much of this
UNK are carried on to tell the reader something he must know or to UNK into him some explanations of a writer
persons act not as they would act probably in life but enable to do the to but enable to author to do a bit of writing
everything is made to change just in the nick of time and even the return letter office UNK its laws that jane eyre may carry on a tale with effect
the fiction belongs to that school where minute UNK of the mind UNK over incidents
the last being made UNK to description or the display of character
a story which contains nothing beyond itself is a very narrow representation of human life
jane eyre is this
if we admit it to be true but its truth is not UNK in the principal incidence and still less in the manner in which the characters influence the incidents so as to produce conduct
there is a low tone of behaviour rather of morality in the book
and what is worse than all neither the UNK nor hero attracts sympathy
the reader cannot see anything UNK in mr rochester nor why he should be so deeply in love with jane eyre
so that we have intense emotion without cause
the book however displays considerable skill in the plan on great power but rather shown in the writing than the matter and this UNK a species of interest to the last
although minute and somewhat UNK the first act of a fiction is the most UNK especially the scenes at the UNK school
there are many parts of greater energy in jane eyre than none equal to the following and the quotation is the death of helen burns
oh yeah
oh
what a UNK criticism
ooh
terrible
that's the UNK magazine
that's the one that jane eyre er not jane eyre jane UNK attacks in UNK abbey
yes
erm that's the one that wanted UNK acceptance amongst respectable citizens very much and said that it would never print anything that would bring a UNK to the cheek of a young
oh
girl
so that's the UNK for you
but rochester did er did er when he was trying to UNK himself for committing what was UNK and the works he said when he compared his own wife who was really a mental animal because she very UNK the way she bit people and then he compared her with this sweet UNK jane he did give a reason didn't he
he did
actually i don't
you know
think that's the best reason
i don't think he could only
he was very attracted to her UNK and goodness
she was very good
she was but
mm
it's like that argument that when you look for a marriage partner you're either looking for somebody to re if you're a woman to UNK your father or to be
mm
the total opposite of them
that's right
either way you are totally bound by what
mm
your father is
mm
and it seems to me that in looking for in rochester da UNK admission that he wants a woman who is opposite from UNK
that's right
he's still tied to his first wife
he's got to come to learn to appreciate jane for herself not because she isn't what UNK is
oh well yes
and he was he wasn't cast er sort of er trying to convince her not UNK that erm you know she should bend the rules and be his wife
oh yes
you know in other words
that's right
forget all your principles and marry me because er she is an animal
you know
yes
and you must accept the fact that she's an animal knowing that
but not
yeah
realizing that would change what she loved
yes
absolutely
i mean
yeah
a very different person
yeah
yes
i mean
that's right
jane being jane would never have done it
no
and it's only because you said previously er that she was a sort of feminist that when he said do this do that and she said very frankly to him do you think just because i'm going to marry you i shall commit
did you re did you see that
yes
now if you hadn't have said so liz i wouldn't have realized that she was trying to you know er probe her UNK and er women had a place
i don't i don't think a
mm
i don't think the word erm tt
feminism
feminism can be applied because if
no
she has kept the character and principle
tha that make that make her take those particular roles that she does
there is one passage in which she erm UNK for women not to be kept in such narrow UNK social UNK that their matters
oh yes
are not only making UNK and sewing blankets
that's right
and that sort of thing
and when he tries to take
when he tries to
when she wants to be an equal
she
yes
just wants to go there as an equal
that's right
and he UNK point blank to accept that
mm
yes
you know she's got
mm
to come as his wife
he gets really you know into a paddy almost
i think i can
yes
almost see him sort of getting more and more annoyed just because she won't accept what he says
well because he's
yes
yes
yes
she's challenging his er
this is st john
standards
yes
yes
he's very authoritarian
it does remark
he is indeed
quite early in the book that there was a certain UNK about his christianity
mm
and he she said she wasn't quite sure that it was a warmth or a real passion for
mm
human beings it was just a almost clinical i think it used the word there
yes
st john's christianity is
yes
absolutely
and a need for a power
i mean that's why he's presumably chosen what he wants to do and th and the description at the end of the way he led his life while he was overseas quite incredible
i mean everybody a o clearly had to jump to his tune
mm
yes
you think of these
i wouldn't say very much
better than the erm what his name
the early one who goes to erm UNK you know and er
UNK
UNK
what's his name
oh
yes
he was a UNK
yes he was
yes
they actually described erm in term
he when jane first sees UNK she sees him
mm
she's a child of ten if you remember
yes
and she looked on it he's like a black UNK
mm
yes
with a sort of totem face
mm
stuck on top
yes
she looks all the way up at him cos she's only
UNK
erm st john towards the end of the novel is described as erm he when he's asked jane and she UNK for quarter of hour's time to think
mhm
about going to india with him as his wife he goes and lays down like a UNK
yes
she said on the grass
yes
and i think they're linked by UNK and st john
what i couldn't understand was that
i was UNK
that when
sorry
when she said er erm you know he said you're not fit for love
but then he insisted that she was gonna be his wife which obviously it was like a UNK up frustration in him
but she was
pretty he wanted a
yes but i got the impression he wanted her body
and that's the only reason why he wanted her there that's the only reason why he could not accept her as a friend or an as a UNK
and as a
a man when she meets him
yes
but thought he was a nasty thing
we'll confuse
one at a time
i think quite a lot of it erm books haven't mentioned this er frustrated erm feeling in the grant is that she's come out
mm
er erm that's true enough
yes
and i think the girls definitely saw much that they loved patrick they definitely their branwell i mean
oh
erm they saw him being UNK in a way they were not
mm
if they'd been brought up all girls maybe their fiction would have been different
erm i was talking more about frustrated sexual erm er feelings that er they weren't allowed to you know let go and in their way of life
no
i don't think there was any way in which to let go
that er
at all
no
except in these UNK in which they let
yes
all they
mm
all sorts of feelings
mm
and their erm UNK and UNK these erm
mm
countries they invented
well some of them are then aren't they really
i thought that st john
was UNK in love with the other girl
yes he was
the problem was
yes
yes
he was yes
i thought if he had any passion it was directed to her not i don't think he had it and jane
he
i think it was a
he got fifteen minutes in the of acting
i think it was a power struggle
i think jane nobody he'd not had a woman stand up to him like that before
mm
and he wanted to own it
yes
mm
that's the only way to UNK it isn't it
is to own it
the master
yeah
the master
in any case it was all so UNK
wi he needed a UNK
yes
and cos she if she wasn't going to marry him cos he was far too UNK he couldn't have her
mm
and she was reasonably bright she could take his ideas and be a reasonable UNK to him er in his in his partner duty
so she'd do
she can come
mm
she was co she coming
you know
but was she playing
yes
no
i don't think she was
she she'd been told by the UNK that
yes
she was threatened
mm
well
and so she always thought she was threatened
didn't er rochester
but rochester didn't er didn't think she was playing
he thought she had a UNK and a grace
yes
but
mm
there is a difference a difference
though i expect it
that
yes
and UNK
yes
but
mm
what is UNK
mm
yeah
it's in the eye of the UNK
yeah
yeah
i was gonna say that
would you like to hear george UNK brief comment
ooh yes
in a letter to chap called charles UNK
i have read jane eyre UNK and shall be glad to know what you admire in it
all self sacrifice is good but one could like it to be in a somewhat UNK cause than that of a UNK law which chains a man body and soul to a UNK
of which i think she means UNK
mm
mm
however the book is interesting
only i wish the characters would talk a little less like the UNK and UNK of police reports
oh that's quite
before we go onto that erm how far do you think jane eyre supported this idea
i mean she sort of flew the UNK as it were with you know if the wife was erm presumably the husband in other cases was mad beyond belief it was a good reason for casting her off
how far do you think she went along with it
i mean she could have been er in love with rochester but it looks to me like a beginning of an idea you know that er there are circumstances in which she er
in which divorce would be possible
yes
erm
do you think she supported it
or do you think she just put it there for the argument
i think she
to go with the character
erm
i mean UNK represents erm the dark side if you like of UNK life
you have a contrast between rochester and st john rivers don't you
as the two
mm
men who proposed to jane
and you have rochester who has erm he's not exactly been a UNK and he has shown some restraint he has cared for this wife he's brought her home
and he's cared for this offspring
mm
which may or may not
yes
be his offspring
and at the end he shows enormous courage
mm
when he tries to rescue her from the fire
but UNK if you like represents the erm the UNK side of UNK lust passion if you like
er whereas st john is as tightly controlled as a as a strong UNK band isn't he
mm
everything is held in like this with st john
with rochester it's been let go
mm
mhm
erm i mean i've personally i think the novel is actually a journey
erm i think that jane's erm journey towards independence is erm where she moving towards a position where if you achieve a certain kind of independence you can then choose to give it up
mm
and that's what she does
mm
it's not worth giving it up if you haven't chosen to give it up
mm
mhm
it's a bit like being erm you know you know a christian isn't it
free born
it's only worth it if it's personal if you choose it
it isn't worth it if it was UNK on you or you inherited it's got to be a personal thing
erm so i think jane's is a erm a spiritual journey with a psychological basis
that link between childhood and UNK that she shows that childhood UNK can affect adult UNK opinions
now in this introduction of this
oh yes
this is an old er penguin
yes
it says almost what you're saying
oh does it
yes
oh
that's nice to know
erm
yes
it says erm the theme is an urgently felt personal one an exploration of how a woman comes to maturity in the world of the UNK youth
er erm it goes on to explain but i don't want to
bother you
but er similar
oh
that's thank you
it's always nice to know
people agree with you isn't it
i once
oh yes
for her
mm
mrs
you know the er wife of the famous er UNK
UNK
oh yes
UNK
yes
UNK
she wrote the UNK
oh did she
yes
yes
ah well
yeah
mm
well there you are
two minds great minds
yes that's right
if you if you look at all the men in the this book i mean to begin with the erm cousin the boy when she
horrible
was a child
mm
john rivers
was a horrible thing
yes
in this story
yes
and the girl
and then the erm previous you know the erm he was a UNK character and rochester of course she didn't stay friends with
mm
erm and then and then you get erm rivers who's also a horrible character although in a different way
erm they you wouldn't you know you'd imagine she didn't have a very opinion of the male sex altogether wouldn't you
yes
you would
erm and you'd thi i mean it's also true that she didn't know many
no
yeah
that's true
i mean she knew her brother
isn't it
mm
her father
mm
mm
and erm i mean there was th the UNK who that she eventually married but really they wouldn't know they wouldn't have any male friends
but she made up her mind didn't she that she had to publish this book under a man's name
mm
so she must have been really had really deep feelings about what was going on in society and why she should do that
yes
you know i mean er that is why it's all coming out in the books that's why the all these men she's sort of saying i'll get my own back now you know
i can have anything i want amongst
yes
these vicious nasty UNK not yeah because
that they
she realized how she was living
mm
if they're brought up i mean th the child at the beginning is more UNK against than UNK it's not his fault he's a pain in the UNK it's his brother
oh yes
it's him
he's the one er a pa re well or a as you say branwell was the same brought up he was UNK rotten
yeah
yeah
and how can you expect to turn out reasonable
mm
mm
so sa her comment probably is erm on the UNK rather than anything else
yeah
i mean she doesn't mention this specifically but i mean
but mrs UNK
though there's a certain amount of UNK with boys
yes
you know
yes
oh
in then there was
probably knocked the top off the tree
oh
he's a boy type
yes
of thing you know
make them feel that they're treated as different
so i can see you know
yeah
you know
it's interesting that he dies as well branwell
yes
in the end
there are
so
so in the end she got her come UNK
they all get
well
their come UNK
they do in spite
er mrs grant er absolutely spoilt her own girls which she knows you know
mrs reed
mrs reed
mrs reed
yes
didn't she
she did yes
yes
oh well
yeah
and whereas her father he didn't think of much of the girls at all did he
ca and it was all for the son
erm i think he became very proud of charlotte
mm
erm but i think he tended to leave the bringing up of the girls to his sister in law
oh
UNK
er and i mean as was conventional in those days you educate your sons went to school and you try and educated your girls at home but the aunt put her foot down and said she wouldn't do it
oh
aunt branwell
so that's why the girls went to UNK bridge
erm
but yes i mean he was launched into several different careers by his father with money he could ill spare
course
mm
really
mm
but erm that didn't no that wasn't on offer for the girls
it wasn't available
well that came up in anne in anne UNK book as well didn't he
yes
you know
oh yes
the position of women i mean they were obviously all kicking against it and
they were yes
helen UNK statement
yes
to UNK his mother
mm
yes that happened
that you would have boys go out with no UNK over UNK blocks here there and everywhere and girls who are not even allowed to benefit from UNK experience let alone have their own
that's right
mm
mm
erm having said that i think the novel is al is a spiritual journey erm not only jane's i should say but also UNK
erm and i think it's also a journey towards independence and a journey fro towards belonging if you like from being an UNK to belonging
mm
oh yes
er she is unwanted because she's different because she's UNK as a child isn't she
in the UNK household
she says as an adult looking back i know why they didn't want me
mm
i was so different
and why they didn't like me
erm and that's of course why she's so delighted when she finds that the rivers are her relations
mhm
mm
er and can share her er legacy with them
erm and then of course in the end she belongs entirely to rochester
and that's a free gift isn't it
no that's got horrible commercial UNK
i don't mean that
i mean it's a gift freely given
he he's brought her free choice
yes
it seems to me that she's also saying it's also a plea on charlotte UNK behalf to men to want women who come to them developed independent and
mm
choose to give it up as must the man in
mm
marriage
don't you almost you can almost hear behind the text saying wouldn't you rather have a woman like that
mm
than a woman who's always been either under her father's thumb or brother's thumb and then gets passed to yours
mm
wouldn't you rather have a woman with a mind of her own
yes
er oh yes
can't say no to this
depends on the men
i don't think in those days they wanted women with minds of their own did they
well er st john certainly didn't
i would
i would
no
oh
right
erm speaking
rochester realizes her worth doesn't he
he does yes
mm
very much so
he does
yes
erm and they are both
UNK people
mm
and he was very changed
yes
he was
he changed
he almost bu became very humble and grateful of course
cos she looked after him so
yes
but he was very arrogant in the beginning
erm let's look at a few quotations
er i don't suppose anybody's got the copy i've got which is from a jumble sale
erm the UNK press
i've never heard of it before but
no
no right
so we are the end of chapter six
i've just got that chapter six
the end the end
paragraph beginning UNK speaking she has been UNK to you
right at the end last page
yes
are we all there
jane has just told helen burns her story
and i think she's just been erm has she been UNK by him yet
no
perhaps she hasn't
erm well i asked UNK is not mrs reed a hard UNK bad woman
and helen replies she has been UNK to you no doubt because you see she UNK your cast of character as miss UNK does mine
but how UNK you remember all she has done and said to you
what a UNK deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart
no ill usage so UNK its record on my feelings
would you not be happier if you tried to forget her UNK together with the UNK emotions if excited
life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing UNK or UNK
we are and must be one and all UNK with UNK in this world
but the time will soon come when i trust we shall put them off in putting off our UNK bodies when UNK and sin will fall from us with this UNK frame of flesh and only the UNK of the spirit will remain
the UNK principle of life and thought pure as when it left the UNK to UNK the UNK
UNK it came it will return perhaps again to be UNK to some being higher than man perhaps to pass through UNK of glory from the pale human soul to UNK the UNK
surely it will never on the contrary be suffered to UNK to UNK from man to UNK
no i cannot believe that
i hold another creed which no one ever taught me and which i seldom mention but in which i UNK and to which i UNK for it UNK hope to all it makes eternity a rest a UNK home not a terror and an UNK
besides with this creed i can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime i can so sincerely forgive the first while i UNK the last with this creed revenge never worries my heart UNK never too deeply UNK me injustice never UNK me too low i live in calm looking to the end
now we've seen jane as a UNK little girl haven't we
quite UNK i
mm
think
she really has been treated badly at the UNK
and we're beginning to see her a co coming under UNK influence
mm
being UNK by helen
i think the first evidence we have of that is when UNK has placed her on the stool and publicly UNK her
and this miss temple asks her in her well in her own study to tell her story
and bearing in mind UNK advice she doesn't er express all the UNK she once felt or se or the er let her speech run away with her
mm
and she is wholly believed because of that
mm
mm
mm
in my book the notes er from out of this i have another a er UNK i have creed it's got charlotte UNK own belief
mm
yes
and UNK too i think
if you remember this er the death of erm huntingdon
mm
when the tenant of UNK hall
mm
mm
but at er helen er UNK believed that his spirit would saved
that the UNK would not what was the saying
UNK with anything he UNK made
but erm and charlotte believed it too yes
mm
yes
seem to be in all these UNK though runs outs a lot on lists of er middle
there's always this UNK isn't there
you know that it helping to sort of make the reader er the thing about
well christian virtues and duty were very closely erm
that's right
er related in victorian society you know
yes
it's some UNK to them and some UNK sat behind them
like UNK coming in and penny UNK about what the girls should have and then his wife and daughters come in dressed in UNK and UNK and so on
oh yes
and UNK very often comes i think in the books in this life as well they i mean again in UNK i think you get your UNK don't you and er
you do
yes
i mean helen UNK plea here is not to be to UNK for UNK to come in this life but trust to it erm
in the next
well not to come in the next but rather to you know sort of leave it to a higher justice if you like
cos she separated sin from the sinner in
yes
exactly
yes
which she has to learn to do in
mm
the case of rochester isn't it
she has to learn to
separate his crime of attempted UNK from his love for her
which she does
mm
helen of course is based on UNK of helen on UNK bronte
oh
the eldest girl who died when she was twelve
mm
and who was a little mother
mm
to the whole UNK
and they all where UNK
mm
you know when she died
must have been absolutely UNK wouldn't it
erm right now can following UNK this idea of spiritual development if you go to the end of chapter twenty four
that goes into volume two does it
er i haven't got them divided into
oh mine are in volumes
volumes in mine i'm afraid
oh
well this isn't
two hundred
it's two hundred
have you got the same copy
well mine's er i've got three and then six
yeah have a look by all means yes
this is the
there's plenty there
down there
three o two in wo one of them the twenty fourth
three o two
yes
pardon
oh
ta
right
the last paragraph of the chapter twenty four
this is a first period of UNK if you like
erm when ah jane in a sense is having to keep his passion at bay his UNK er for their wedding at bay by UNK him
yet after all my task was not an easy one often i would rather have pleased than teased him
my future husband was becoming to me my whole world and more than the world almost my hope of heaven
he stood between me and every thought of religion as an UNK between man and the broad sun
i could not in those days see god for his UNK of whom i had made an UNK
oh no
danger isn't it
mm
those are the warning signs
it's too much
it's too much
it can't even had they married at this stage it would not have been right
even had he been UNK
because jane did not look on him as a as a man but as an UNK
mm
she didn't know him well enough
er and i think that's an interesting point that where yo where when you read the story and you think really what prevented them UNK happily then was UNK but it wasn't it was their attitudes to each other
mm
shall we break for a drink now
and
mm
erm
mm
meet again at five to
mm
yes
for the sake of recording
we are
erm we have st john's proposal to her
shall i read it very briefly it takes er time to find it doesn't it
er she but as brother and sister erm UNK your complicated interest st john says to her feelings thoughts wishes aims merge all considerations in one purpose that of fulfilling with effect with power the mission of your great master
to do so you must have a UNK not a brother that is a loose tie but a husband
i too do not want a sister a sister might any day be taken from me
i want a wife the sole UNK i can influence efficiently in life and retain absolutely till death
well she describes that as like an iron UNK
turning
and then a few pages on when she says erm we must abandon the scheme of marriage
no
it said he it is a long UNK scheme and the only one which can secure my great end
my great end
but i shall urge you no further at present tomorrow i leave for cambridge
i have many friends to whom i should wish to say UNK
i shall be absent a fortnight
take that space of time to consider my offer and do not forget that if you reject it is not me you deny but god
through my meanings he opens to you a noble career as my wife only can you enter upon it
refuse to be my wife and you limit yourself forever to a track of selfish ease and UNK
if that isn't
erm
erm
UNK there
yes religious UNK i don't know what is
i mean he says he's he knows that he is erm poor material that he's inadequate UNK will be made up by god
oh
but if you reject it but it's not me you deny but god
his ego is enormous
mm
erm
beyond the truth
yes
and it certainly makes you feel more UNK towards rochester doesn't it
yes i think so yes
erm but that is in a sense part of jane's spiritual education isn't it
mm
she has to learn to distinguish UNK sh to recognize the UNK of that statement
mm
mm
to sort god from st john rivers if you like
and she does
mm
mm
well she wants to be his UNK er she does use the UNK
she does yes
yes
and erm
yes
oh i mean er i know we can have different opinions on why we think st john is so UNK that she must be his wife i do think it's a power struggle
i don't think he's come across any
mm
so independently minded as jane
and he can't erm he can't quite live with that
he certainly isn't going to live with it independent
he's going to have it under his thumb
it did rather stretch
but erm
my UNK when she UNK over the UNK and she was at UNK door and she turned up at her UNK
well
UNK house
yes
i mean it
is that erm is i mean we can look at that two ways i mean
is that divine intervention
mm
erm coincidence
or as you say beyond the UNK
yes
but still it's all part of the
well the psycho
well the plot
the UNK communication at the end when they come together
yes
again i mean that is stretching the UNK the belief a bit far
well that is er
i mean UNK clearly
yes the voice of
yes
mm
mind you it
yes it did
erm it you know th if she UNK charlotte bronte clearly believes in divine intervention doesn't she
and in the context of what sh of what she was writing
mm
and when she was writing
yeah i think it's fair enough
i mean it UNK our belief cos
yes
we don't believe that you can
yes
hear voices up above
is this the creed
i don't know
i but i believe in UNK
but of course i is that what
yes i believe in UNK but i don't believe in g and i shall come
yeah
to you and
yes
he heard the voice say
you can't no
oh no not that both listened in at the time
dorothy
although i do think that probably erm religion at that time er could have been this very narrow rigid
mm
kind of erm idea
i mean the church UNK probably erm this kind of religion or some of the churches
mm
did
mm
you know this sort UNK i suppose erm you know following the UNK tradition
yes
but they were very narrow very rigid
yes
and erm
that's right
cos you might say that it was all for the sort of poor old pe people down
ooh you could certainly say that yes
mm
erm
but in the middle of this we've still got a fairly young woman with vivid imagination
mm
yes
we have
yes
yes
yeah
and strong feeling
yeah
yes
yeah
mm
yes
erm in a sense you have it it's erm a UNK construction isn't it
a sort of a UNK if you like you start off with one position represented by rochester which is too much passion UNK passion
mm
almost
i mean a apart from UNK i know he was UNK into it by his father and brother that marriage but he
yes
surely wouldn't have gone through it if UNK hadn't UNK to him
no
no
erm if he hadn't wanted her at least at first
well jean UNK says that she's a beauty
yes
absolutely
yes
but she also had a big UNK
yes
well that was the
the father and brother who saw
yes
that didn't they
yeah
erm
there was
and then he has erm UNK doesn't he
UNK
oh yes
mother
yes
yes
and or UNK
yes that's right
and then UNK and er somebody's else's name i
oh yes
can't remember
yes
yeah
erm and then we come as it were to the second position which is st john rivers
mm
who actually does fall in love who would have him
oh
and UNK er UNK oliver UNK that totally in his nature
erm for his religious mission
mm
and then you come to rochester at the end erm oh well i mean without finding quotations erm he is the UNK isn't it
he is the meeting of the two points
he
mm
is erm you know the one UNK lamb if you like that comes back
and erm i mean accepts jane and thanks god and determines to be better
you know he reforms doesn't he
mm
but without any of the religious UNK
mm
that we've seen from st john rivers
did he turn to jane eyre erm after he'd been rejected by erm the other woman the oliver woman
no
no
no he'd ha she'd had it
yes
i mean i think he shows her no encouragement
cos she went off with another chap
instead of
yeah
instead of
he then thought right whe who can i look for now type of thing
wha what happened first
do you see what i mean
i think they UNK apart UNK and st john
they did
or at least
she did
but she was UNK wasn't she
that was the UNK that
yes
she was completely UNK for the like he was determined
to meet
yes
they couldn't marry e even though he loved her
yes er
too much conflict and
she would have a miserable life of course
mm
oh yes
she really would
well any wife of his would have had a miserable life
i have no time for st john rivers at all
no
erm
and he was such a UNK wasn't he
he was
yes
he was a UNK
UNK
he one of these people who allies their own opinions and feelings with the higher authority that they erm
with god
exactly
it's that er in jane UNK
that they were recognized
er which one is
UNK
UNK
UNK
oh yes
in his yeah the thing
oh yes
that's right
yeah he is
yes
he is indeed
they must have existed these characters
oh yes
that you know UNK mustn't
yes
they
yes
UNK agrees UNK that kind of religion
there is a such
yes
it's impossible to carry out
i knew one once
yes
you did
oh
i UNK
yes
yes
but on the other hand i wonder how any of them were really i mean er our own minister at our own church he is extremely intellectual and very theological and a wonderful man of compassion
these men were just given UNK weren't they
yes
mm
to UNK up all these awful ones
they weren't very
that's right yes
which i don't think they were truly good it was quite a good reasonable living wi with a house thrown in
but it wasn't a calling
no
no
no
it wasn't a UNK
not at all
but they thought
not a UNK
it was didn't they
they pretend it was
but i didn't you send your
oh yes
wasn't it the third of fourth son
third
who went into the
went into church
church
yes
yeah
yeah
was it the first to the army
army the law
yes
or
the law that's it
so it was only third choice was it
arithmetic
i'm informed it's usually the fourth
i don't i don't know if it's
it's the third or fourth
oh yes
in charlotte
but the a child a year
eighteen children
yes
oh right
erm
let's come to the gothic in jane eyre in why in a sense i it's in our reading UNK it's on our reading list this term
mhm mm
let me read you a couple of paragraphs from er an essay on the new gothic in jane eyre by erm and american UNK called robert UNK
some years ago UNK wilson complained of writers of gothic who could fail to lay hold on the UNK that lie deep in the human soul and have caused man to fear himself
unquote
and proposed an UNK of horror stories that probe psychological UNK and find UNK
this is precisely the direction in which charlotte bronte moved
this was one aspect of her following human emotions where they took her into many depths and UNK that has yet hardly had a place in a novel
this was the UNK achievement of gothic
gothic is UNK defined
in a recent book review UNK implies that gothic is UNK mystery UNK
whereas f UNK defines the gothic tradition which he considers nearly central in american literature as a UNK exploration of the avenues to death
for UNK on the other hand gothic was the essence of UNK and UNK was the UNK expression of UNK
both these latter definitions though they are UNK inclusive have suggested value
for originally gothic was one of the number of UNK developments which serve to breach the classical and rational order of life and to make possible a kind of response and a response to a kind of thing that among the knowing had long been taboo
in the novel it was the function of gothic to open UNK beyond social patterns rational decisions and UNK approved emotions
in a word to UNK the sense of reality and its impact on the human being
it became then a great UNK of feeling but acknowledged the non rational in the world of things and events occasionally in the realm of the UNK ultimately and most UNK in the depths of the human being
the first gothic writers took the easy way
the excitement of UNK scene and happening which i call old gothic
of this charlotte bronte made some direct use while at the same time tending towards UNK which are anti gothic
but what really counts is this indirect UNK to her it released her from the patterns of the novel of society and therefore permitted the UNK of her real talent a talent for finding and giving dramatic form to UNK and feelings which because of their depth or UNK or UNK or ambiguity or of their ignoring or UNK every day UNK of UNK or reason increase UNK the sense of reality in a novel
to note the emergence of this new gothic in charlotte bronte is not i think to pursue an old mode into UNK corners but rather to identify historically the UNK and the distinguished element in her work
now let's look at the UNK in jane eyre
and think of er in the light of the UNK we've already discussed
erm she is struggling out of UNK on others into independence isn't she
which she then freely UNK for love
she's UNK clear sighted UNK and UNK
so that's my list of UNK you can certainly add more if you want to
and with a keen sense of injustice
actually that UNK keen sense of injustice i couldn't find anywhere else as strongly UNK except in great expectations
do you know when the young UNK
mm
as a boy
mm
and his sister married to joe UNK is bringing him up and she UNK him
mhm
mm
and she at bed time she gets hold of him by the UNK of the neck and
mm
UNK him upstairs so that his boots bang against the stairs at every step he hasn't time to put his feet down
and he says it wasn't my fault
mm
i was born and it was not my fault i was there
don't you get the feeling of oliver twist
yes
i think so to some extent
mm
mm
it's perhaps it's too long since i read oliver twist for me to remember it as clearly
but that's the that's the idea that came to my mind anyway
UNK in great expectations
which is i mean it just you know as UNK connections these things do pop up in your mind
erm i think of the UNK that we've studied emily also perhaps we could include UNK from UNK erm UNK from uncle UNK helen huntingdon from UNK hall and UNK i would say not UNK she's not in this tradition
mhm mm
but UNK from the mystery of UNK i think jane is most like helen huntingdon
mm
hardly surprising when you think
mm
they were sisters
mm
er the writers were sisters
erm although i think UNK could have been in this tradition don't you
she was certainly UNK enough
aha
mm
erm i mean it's a new position though isn't it
struggling out of UNK in order to freely give up your independence
we haven't come across that before have we
no
in a UNK gothic UNK
well no
but we know much more about erm jane eyre than we do about UNK
mm
UNK
yes
oh yes
she is only
in fact this is the problem
she is only
mm
discussing all characters from
yes
UNK isn't it
yes
yes
that they we don't
that's right
know where they were going to go
that's right
jane eyre is a complete character isn't she
mm
yes
and on both sides you have this sort of UNK and
and she developed
drawing our UNK
yeah she grows doesn't she
mm yes
mm
but even helen huntingdon doesn't seek independence in order to freely give it up again
no
no
no she doesn't
she erm if in a sense she's already fixed onto the next generation hasn't she
she wants to save arthur her son
mm
she wouldn't have sought her independence at all if it hadn't been at such
mm
she wouldn't have wanted it
oh well she
that's right
may have wanted it but she wouldn't have done it
no
i don't think she would
but erm
well why not
jane eyre didn't really look upon erm herself as giving up her independence er by UNK rochester did she
no
and it was erm formed within herself really
yes
yes
the other way around really isn't
mm
it
i mean
yes
he was going to be dependant upon her so she was taking on
oh
that's it yes
she wasn't er
oh
i think that i think she does make
possibly yeah
it really clear though to him when he says in fact i their dialogue took away
i'll be your eyes and all
yes
that
yes
erm
yes
she does make it clear to him that she is not
mm
simply going to be his nurse
nurse
no
and his wife in that sense
she needs him
mm
as much as he needs her
but after it all she's gonna be the one that's going to need the erm the strength
mm
yes
it is her erm moral strength if you like
mm
yes
and er because she's
i can't think what she's giving up
mm
no it's just fulfilment isn't it
mm
it is yes
but that's what i mean by freely giving up
you are giving up your independence
i mean she's got a competence that
yes but what was her independence if she didn't marry him
well she could have been
i mean where was what would she have done
i mean she could have probably had
which would have meant
she didn't need to do anything she didn't want to
no sh she had five thousand
yes i know
she had a lot of money
but what was she going to
she was a still a single woman
but she wanted to actually
she was
in those times single women really didn't have much
she wanted to own her own shop
no but i
oh right
thi i certainly think
okay
she and diana and mary could have lived quite happily
yes
yes
mm
mm
erm and i think it's important that she's left this legacy
mm
to show that she does give up
well yes
oh yes
material
mm
independence
mm
they both had husbands
quite UNK
didn't they
so no doubt
yes
yes
so really i she couldn't probably ever live on her own
yes
necessary
i would say that she is the strongest woman er UNK that we've read
when you think of UNK
that's right
oh yes
er uncle UNK
mm
er the UNK women UNK and the
oh
UNK was dreadful
you know but this is the
yes
first one who's stood up on her own
there's he helen huntingdon
absolutely
she did it too well didn't she
as much as that
yeah
yeah
erm no
no
i think jane UNK stronger but helen
yes
yes
huntingdon did stand up and go against
yes
erm all the
the law and the er religious er instruction of the time didn't she
yes she did
i mean didn't erm oh i can't remember his name
that UNK of a of a UNK not UNK er vicar
oh yes
in UNK hall who told her that really she ought not to have left her husband
yes
that's right
erm unless he had bodily UNK her
oh yes
and that should be no minor thing
mm
i think she was very good like that UNK
yes
properties
women out if anything we se the first book we read was back in seventeen hundred
that's right
yeah
go on
and it's a everybody was shown then
yes
the independence of women are getting more independent each by the century decade you know
yes
and of course she was educated
wasn't she
and she had erm
she had a good
she had a
education
she had as well yeah
well it's
which meant that she was more liberal minded
yes
with her particular character it made her more liberal minded
mm
and maybe she
than the other ones the elder ones
yes
yes it did yes
i mean
i
because it can't be so unusual for girls to be education in a se i mean i just don't know anything this i it's a blank in my mind
but if there was schools like UNK
mm
with good people at the head of them like miss temple erm then th it wouldn't be on its own
they must er especially if it was up
well they you had
in the far north out in the
yes
sticks erm there must have been quite a few schools for girls
mm
around
but there wasn't much
they must have been UNK
for them do with it except to become UNK
that's what they're chosen for
was there
no
yes but the presentation itself i was thinking about
mm
i mean the
mm
the idea of UNK girls must have been allowed
you had to be able to pay
pardon
you had to be able pay
yes
weren't they
i mean most of them
any couldn't make any progress
i'd be getting
yes quite
yes she was a very strong character esther
yeah
williams
she saw five husbands off didn't she
yes
oh yes
erm yes i mean as i understand it girls were expected to be educated at home by their mother
yes
who would have been educated at home by her mother
and if those circumstances were not er UNK then the girls could be sent away to school
mm
erm but i think we've got we've got erm UNK bridge in the early part of UNK and i think we've got really UNK head school at the end UNK as it were
UNK second school
mm
when she went back as a teacher
mm
when she was much more enlightened er and the where the learning standard er UNK was much better simply because the girls were cared for
mm
if you're if you're if you're cold and hungry you're not learning are you
no
i mean she started
mm i know
with the village children didn't she
or he did as the
ye
whe well who
well jane i mean er jane did that
oh yes
in er UNK
yes
right
yes
that's right yes
er so i mean that was
unusual
yes
yes it was
yes for the UNK daughters and
and it was for girls for girls
yes
there was already one in existence belonging to
there was a class thing there as well i noticed
mhm mm
it didn't like them at first because she felt that they were very rough and UNK
mm
that's right
but as she got to know them
yes
she began to like them
oh yes
yes
mm
yeah so it
yeah
showed people kept in their classes didn't
yes
they
that's right
they did
yes
i remember there was one
but she learnt she was open to it wasn't
yes
she
yes
mm
yes
she was opened to having her mind changed
very UNK for
yes
and of course there was another bit
aha
which i thought was rather UNK about UNK you know she managed to kind of erm UNK the french
well that's right
but french was
i have a big UNK mark yes
yes
besides
the other french was okay but the
that's right
french part was definitely
yes
UNK
she had an english ed education
that's right yes
erm
erm i must ask a question
yes
something that puzzled me as i read it er
yes
earlier on in the book was the pictures that rochester looked at
mm
and
oh yes
they seemed to me to be heavy with UNK but i couldn't see anything
he did say were you happy when you painted them
yeah
you know
yes
apart from that i thought well why are they there you know
well one of them
he was clever
more or is more or less is realized in a dream she has just before she leaves UNK hall erm in which she dreams she's lying in the red room again
mm
erm er where she had her nightmare
that's right
mm
and then the ceiling turns into a sky and then a this sort of head and shoulders of a woman er UNK woman an arm reaches through and a and a face comes and er she says erm er and it says my child don't give in to temptation
and she says i won't mother
mm
now whether it's meant to be really her mother or
mm
in a sense that one might call women of the generation before yours mother i'm not sure
mm
and that's what UNK her to get up and UNK hall
mm
and that's you see this is one of the things that contemporary critics some contemporary critics couldn't take that jane wanted rochester as much as rochester
mm
wanted jane
wanted jane
mm
jane had her own sexuality
mm
had her own feelings her own passion
mm
erm the temptation was also on her side
mm
she was not a passive little thing
ooh
no
to be done with
no
as he would see fit
she had her own feelings
yes
is that why this bit
yes
that's one of the reasons
yeah
cos it was written by men about well they wouldn't have known that though would they
cos er it was it was written under the
no
na no but there a lot of speculation
mm
in the time
yes
do you think that the er it must be the war the first world war if you've been watching testament of youth fear and britain's testament of youth which i read years ago
mm
and the
mm
but when she says to her look father she wants to go to university
mm
ah oh na no
can't go there that's didn't he
so i think that
first world war sort of really opened up education to women and really more than anything
mm
isn't it terrible that it takes a war
and that was nineteen fourteen eighteen it was quite a
yes but they all went into the factories didn't they
or they found bits
mm
yes
well what's worrying is that this
that's higher education
that they we're in a UNK like to the thirties
yes
yes
and it took the war to come out of that what are we gonna get out of get out
exactly
of this
yes
but we won't get onto that
perhaps we're talking about it
that's a different subject for us
erm
a subject
there were plenty of UNK women really you know a man came from UNK families who didn't er just go off er you know
yes
yes i take your point they were the UNK
erm
yes
but there weren't
mm
i mean the fact that they are so UNK to us
and especially i mean erm
yes
and elizabeth UNK who UNK
yes
the prisons
you could almost count them on the fingers of two
yes
hands couldn't you
of course
yes
yeah
anyway the UNK were always different
yes
mm
er i mean their women were always allowed to do things
yes they were
weren't they
they were much more enlightened as well
they were never their father
well no
ha
could do without them
yes
erm to come back to what we were saying about the UNK
well my mind UNK with the UNK and that
right
yes
cos i'm eighty two now
yes
i think it's erm
her expression
her expression really of the psychological in
yes
the novel
yes
mm
erm it comes out in her dreams jane's dreams particularly this baby she's always carrying i mean
mm
oh yes
if people know how to interpret what it means to be carrying a baby in a dream please
no
tell me
i mean
no
apart from the UNK one that somebody's going to die
yes
erm which she sa betty UNK
erm and it is sort of a controlled way if you like of allowing the UNK to be expressed
mm
like you i couldn't interpret the UNK in any particular way and i don't think we really need to
i mean maybe there are others who could who can do it and explain them to me and i'd be very grateful if they could but erm in detail
but i that's how i interpret anyway
i've wasted twenty minutes on that
well it was very a very interesting image
quite often
isn't it
yes
because
but quite often
so much of it's sub UNK
yes
yeah
i mean it could be passion in fact
yes
a little bit on the top but so much underneath
yes
well yes
yes
it is an interesting
image
obviously took teddy twenty minutes to think that this UNK was a it was a valid symbol
thank you very much
well that's alright
that's what UNK for so you
well yes
can bother
that's right
was it because of the passion that the excuse me these women seem to er be UNK having that made them think that er it wasn't er a male who wrote the book or not
that may well be one of the reasons yes
that a passion was UNK to a women
i have a feeling that there is a female sort of tone about it
yes
and
mm
that there was also a sort of blow for freedom being struck if you like
mm
which perhaps a ma a male writer wouldn't
mm
make
mm
it was also about the little girl wasn't it
who grows up i mean it was
mm
yes
i shouldn't think many men would have UNK to have written it was all her then in the first person
who was
about being a small child
about being a small little girl
there's a lot about clothes
mhm mm
er you know jane UNK and bronte they wrote quite a lot about clothes which meant probably but always i felt the UNK could see into the minds of women you know and he was good
yes
but he didn't go into detail about what they were wearing but there's quite a lot about what she was wearing
yes
thomas UNK
you know
i think is also excellent
oh yes
oh yes
he's very good
yes
on women
let's look at some erm gothic elements er it's no good saying page a hundred and one is it
do you mean that when you say gothic elements do you mean a UNK for mystery
yes
erm
yes
because i
i mean i think what i think erm charlotte bronte does in this she introduces certain gothic elements which she then immediately UNK
mm
mm
er and it's interesting to ask why
and i thought we might look at a few of them
mm
erm
but surely the house is a name or a
well
within this awful voice
that's right
yes
but that's not so much the building as th
don't you think so
as the a as terror and
mm
terror is another erm
yes
you know part of it
oh a bit of gothic feeling
mm
it's terror from the beginning
i mean terror
mm
in the red room is UNK
yes
yes
there is indeed yes
well part of that is awful
and also the trip into UNK was also frightening
yes
yeah
it was yes
the er the
for somebody that age
erm i was thinking more of the this adult jane erm
mm
coming to a bit
but i thought the UNK voices was gothic wasn't it
mm
oh yes
i think that's the one point that she doesn't undermine
mm
the UNK communication
yes
and what about mr UNK past
that that's always there isn't it
mm
we never really know what happened
it's very hard when you know this novel
is it ever explained
to erm to try and remember what it was like when you read it for the first time
yes
has anybody read it for the first time for this course
right
do you feel
you
i'm an expert on it
yes
yes
erm
mm
did you feel a tremendous sense of mystery gathering around rochester
that there were clues put in here and there that things were not right and that jane was seeing all
erm
before the ex you know that she knew about UNK
yes i think it would be fair to say that but you wondered how he came to be the kind of man that he she found him
mm
but yes i think that'll be fair to say that
erm i also found that th surprisingly that there's little UNK of humour roundabout rochester
mm
mm
which i found a little bit surprising
mm
mm
erm the boy
mm
you know and he said well produce your witness i've gone to hell
and he said well i'll produce a witness first
you know i mean
yes
sort of
that's right yes
i thought well that's odd
you know what it's supposed to be a terror of a horror story
mm
mm
and but i think it sort of highlight er she might have done it UNK or consciously i don't know
i think the erm character of rochester yes he comes across as a er as quite a mystery man
mm
you keep finding out things about him that
mm
yes
you're not quite expecting
yes
that's
mm
ah
you know he UNK up on the horse you know
mm
mm
yes
turns out to be flesh and blood after all
yes
mm
well erm
falls off the horse
there is a gesture there of course which is UNK right at the end isn't it
when he UNK on her to walk back to his horse
mm
and then he UNK on jane right at the
oh yes
end
oh
to walk back into the house
yes
i see
erm when he's UNK and
mm
erm
the trouble is if you if you read it as ha many people have found er some years ago and then
yes
read jean UNK wide UNK sea
mm
that's right
that's right yeah
yes
and then you read it again
and you've got that in your mind
yes
that's right
of er
absolutely
did you find that too
yes
i found it very disturbing
i couldn't finish it now
in a sense that takes the gothic out of UNK
mm
yes
doesn't it
yes it does
yes
because it shows
her own UNK
yes
yes
erm she is not something simply to be afraid of
she has you see how she has been pushed into this position
mm
and how two cultures failed entirely to understand each other
mm
mm
and should never have been brought together in the first place
and of course if you look at it er UNK i mean for a woman to be tied up and kept in a room you know and kept prisoner all her life you could hardly expect her to be UNK even if she did
have a chance to get which
yes
she wouldn't have been able to i mean yo to
yes
ti treat someone like an animal then
yes
they'll behave like an animal
yes
yeah
so i mean it was clearly that you know of knowing how to deal with mad
yes
people
i mean what was UNK if
yes
we asked
erm just looking at one or two references
when mrs UNK is showing jane over the house
mm
erm and she says do the jane asks do the servants live in these rooms
mhm mm
no they occupy a range of smaller UNK to the back no one ever UNK here
one would almost say that if there were a ghost at UNK hall this would be its UNK so i think
we're up on the third floor here
mm
mm
erm whereas we know erm mrs rochester is kept
you have no ghost then
mm
none that i ever heard of returned mrs UNK smiling
nor any traditions of one no UNK or ghost stories
i believe not
and yet it is said the UNK have been a violent than a quiet race in their time perhaps though that is the reason they rest UNK in their graves now
erm and then a on we go i mean and then she hears this laugh you see
i
mm
mean are there UNK are there UNK
no there aren't
mm
everything's okay it's just the family you know
mm
mm
erm then she hears that laugh you know probably grace poole did you hear it again
mm
erm yes you know and er we
that's a bit of the gothic
she's UNK all the time
mm
mm
it's the bit of the gothic except that we know that this is well we don't know then do we
no
no
no and it says erm i really did not expect any grace to answer
mrs UNK has just called grace poole
mm
for the laugh was as tragic as UNK a laugh as any i ever heard
and but that it was high noon and no circumstance of UNK the curious UNK
but that neither scene nor season favoured fear i should have been UNK afraid
mm
but she wasn't
mm
cos it was high noon
mm
and mrs UNK had explained it
mhm mm
however the event showed me i was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise
so we have the gothic set up and promptly knocked down again
mm
so
and then it go comes up again with UNK
oh yes
it does indeed yes
i mean erm she actually then chooses to walk up and down the third storey erm couple of pages later jane when she wants a bit of UNK
mm
so it can't have been that frightening
this place she chooses to think over her own hopes
well
and plans and so on
erm when she UNK that er i think you pronounce it a UNK
i don't know any other way of UNK it
mm
a kind of ghost is going to be riding down the path for er when it's actually a rochester
mm
you know
erm it's only a UNK taking a short cut
mm
but no UNK appeared she says just a UNK taking a short cut
all her fears are then all knocked down
mm
so that you're having the gothic set up in this story to be undermined by common sense
oh
mm
a at the time it is raised that's the interesting thing
not like mrs UNK
mm
building tension and mystery to the end and then UNK it all
no
but er
and even when they erm the stranger comes you know
mm
who's the brother and erm had his arm injured
oh yes
mm
erm he's and even then she accepts doesn't she or she appears to accept what she's told
yeah
she does yes
mm
i mean there is one when she says that UNK face reminded her of a UNK i suppose that's probably the most gothic moment
mm
but then when you think that she did actually bite UNK
yes
of course
quite hard i mean really hard
mm
yes
er and tries to bite rochester on the face doesn't she
yes
yes
erm then she becomes a sort of literal th the UNK as it were is reduced and she becomes just a wild thing
mm
yeah
so that actually that comment
on her being a UNK is also undermined
but she was a UNK
because that wasn't the first time when she eventually burnt the place down
yes
she tried before
yes
mm
so she had this UNK as well
yes
i mean are we to see that as UNK the setting fire to UNK bed
the burning bed
could well be
UNK bed perhaps
yes
mm
mm
certainly jean UNK erm i mean i thought of jean UNK at that
mm
point UNK that backwards if you can
mm
UNK backwards
doesn't she
i've forgotten a lot of the book
i didn't have time to read it all and how far in comparison with the other gothic UNK do you go before you as a reader know about this woman er kept up you know in er
the quarters
UNK forest
erm
half way exactly
yes
should think about half way through
it
yes
you know
when you find out
mhm mm
erm
mm
it's incredible to me that jane has all these er things happening
mm
UNK is the word
yes
or UNK yes
UNK yes
and er she never really she's never really very curious
no
a erm
well she UNK
it is it is never he doesn't not actively curious
no
she accepts
right
explanations doesn't she
mm
yes she does
but then you wouldn't
yes
think of the mad wife being shut up there
no
by
you might if you were catherine UNK
yes
it's a bit like this
but UNK abbey is but she is absolutely
but UNK abbey was definitely a bit curious
yes
but what i was going on to say was that erm grace what's her name
poole
grace
grace poole
mm
er everything's blamed onto grace poole but she's but she
i don't
UNK
mm
she's never dismissed
mm
oh yes
and wouldn't er jane be UNK about that
well
she does wonder about it yes but she's
oh yes
ah i mean she's got a UNK role in the house hasn't she
mhm mm
erm i mean and mrs UNK is not really open to erm giving her the information
no er tha
is she
i think doesn't she ask her at one point about grace poole
mm
and mrs UNK
oh
yeah
turns the conversation
yes
mm
mm
erm
but th the servants are all talking about this erm aren't they at one point
yeah
and she UNK them
mm
but she as you say she's not really curious
no
to find out why she's being kept in the dark and
yes
everyone else knows
yes
she's also told that it's grace poole that slept by the UNK bed
yes
mm
mm
erm but things go on as usual
yes
yes
yes
this is i found UNK
yeah i found this
yes
a bit hard to swallow
yes
but she said he would explain
want to find out more
you know
yes he did
mm
he
yo you know and himself
from their marriage that's right
yes
true
but she knows that grace poole is a and
yes
she's been living with a brother
mm
mm
yes
erm sorry
who's the UNK
sorry
sorry
i
who's been living with him
too
oh
charlotte
UNK charlotte bronte
yes
with the brother who UNK
yes
yes
so erm she presumably being used to sort of accepting these er UNK and behaviour
yeah
thinking it was drink and so why shouldn't she UNK in that jane eyre accepts
grace poole drinks and she gets your erm
yes
lively bits of behaviour but then
mm
it all UNK again and you have to accept it
but why is she there
mm
yes
she isn't UNK i mean yo er erm i can see if you it could get in the way of accepting the story
mm
erm what i found actually er erm even UNK was that is if the servants knew about her why did nobody appear at the wedding ceremony
mm
why was it left to UNK
yes
yes
to come forward
he had been paid
i don't i don't think they knew that she was his
his wife
wife
don't know
they knew that he had er erm
a mad woman
a mad woman upstairs but i
yes
don't see as though knew her was his wife
yes
well i said they
er but they did wor wonder whether it was erm
mm
mm
an ex UNK
yes
a relation or
mm
something
er it didn't come out even where the er inn keeper is telling erm her telling jane about what happened
mm
and he obviously didn't know and it wasn't public knowledge that it was his wife that was
oh no
kept there it wasn't just
no
this woman
mm
yes erm
erm i think what erm the purpose for me anyway or the effect of under setting up the gothic in detail and then UNK it is that when you do allow it to stand it's much more effective
mm
mm
mm
and that i think is
mhm mm
i mean i know we can dispute that this UNK communication is actually rather far UNK but it is quite dramatic
mm
isn't it
mm
that's right
that at the moment at which she's about to submit
mhm mm
to st john erm she hears the call as it were from somebody who really needs
mm
her
doesn't just
even through the nightmare she
mm
yeah
it's a it's a er a UNK that nobody
yes
can see
and he heard the reply
mm
yes
and he goes through
yes
yeah
i think even more frightening the fact that she might have UNK to this chap
i was saying for god's sake don't do it
i really was frightened that she might be off with him
well what i found a bit erm remarkable really in the book
mm
was that er parts of it were pure UNK weren't they
mm
mm
yes
they really were
yes but doesn't it come off when
yeah
they do the film of it it's much more dramatic and UNK
yes
than the novel because you
yes
don't get a rational explanation
no
in the film
no you don't
you get the atmosphere very strongly
what will
and it comes off far more as a you know as a sort of gothic
mm
story
yes
than the novel
what could have been a really gothic moment in the novel and quite deliberately isn't it seems to me is jane's UNK of UNK
when after the UNK
yes
wedding ceremony they all UNK up to the third storey
yes
yes
to meet this mad
yes
woman
at this point we're not having any of jane's reactions
we've got UNK erm UNK
account
as it were
yes
mm
yes
erm a mixture of anger and shame and er UNK and er justification and so on
and he places his hand as he said on his jane's shoulder and says this is i this quiet girl standing there this is what i wanted and look what i've you know
mm
can you blame me when you see
yes
what i've got
mm
and she is not terror UNK she is not horrified she's not UNK in a corner jane i mean
no
she's just standing there
really quite strong
yes
taking it in
mm
and she says later sh you you're too cruel to rochester you can't blame her for being mad
mm
and so what could have been a really gothic moment isn't
mm
and it seems to me quite deliberately isn't
it's made a moment of er dramatic moment er a UNK moment
mm
but not a gothic moment
but even the fire where you know the first fire don't they when she burnt house down erm that isn't made as UNK as it
no
could have been
no
it's quite funny actually
yes
yes
because he wakes up and
yes
says is there a flood
what
yes
that's right
are you doing UNK me in my bed
you know
yes
cos she's thrown all this water over him
but i mean that's a UNK thing to have found him in
oh yes
flames and er
and then there's one little
sort of almost UNK really when she says i'll go and get a UNK and he says don't go yet
yes
yes
wait till i put something on
i know
erm and er you could pass it
you really could pass it
erm
and it's you know it's part of life isn't it
i
it's
couldn't help thinking if it was modern day a woman that's UNK depressed UNK that UNK she had she was definitely mental she would be stuck in a mental home and just kept under with er
drugs
exactly
drugs
yes
she certainly wouldn't be UNK round
and you know won i wonder whether
she wasn't yeah
whether it's kind of him to keep her there
mm
because she's quite well looked after
well exactly
yes
yes
mm
yes
but there must have been cases weren't there
oh yes
yes but that's to that would be terrible if you had this
yes but that's then i mean perhaps rochester was UNK
yes
so in case that does happen
yes
yeah absolutely
he and then
yes
he didn't want anybody to know but i think in he did that in the UNK fashion
mm
that is possible actually that he would want to keep it from his neighbourhood
yes
mm
true
that he were married to a mad woman
but if sh she was in care
they would put her somewhere else though wouldn't
no
qui quite possibly they wouldn't
so he would have been safer
no
wouldn't he actually than
yes
put her in a mental hospital or a
mm
or a mental institute
yes
mm
somebody in authority would have known that he was married though but probably not anybody who could have done anything about preventing another one
no
mm
yeah but we wouldn't have had the story would we
well
no quite
er in some cases
they were beaten and UNK
oh
that's right
yes
oh
dreadful yes
i think you just can't
yes
yes
yes it was a duty of them wasn't it
mm
to beat the devil out of them
yeah
yeah
most dreadful time
and left abandoned there weren't they
oh
yes
yes
yes
they were
nasty
some are still
UNK in film
erm er in that UNK film whatever
oh
was it called
the music makers
oh yes
mm
erm with UNK
yes
mm
mm
absolutely
incredible
that oh
it was awful
did you see it
no
oh
it's it was absolutely incredible
i think early in the eighteen twelve
made it forever
really
mm
mm
oh lord
well we had the UNK
yeah
to thank for improving the law on prisoners
oh yes
we did
and the mental that's right
i think
yeah
they were wonderful
at least prisons er
what they did
yes
absolutely
yes
was amazing
yes
and wonderful really
well that's right
mm
mm
yeah
all the
erm
have we said all we want to say about st john and his er UNK
oh yes
i think so yes
cos partly i expect his trouble was repression too
i think that he was
was such a UNK erm religious
yes
because he wa he was obviously a very repressed man wasn't he
absolutely
UNK and
yes
and emotionally he had repressed his
yeah
desire for UNK hadn't he
yes
mm
yes
erm and that is the way that
and UNK
erm yo i mean he says at one point as a positive statement he thinks that he bend he's UNK his nature out of its natural course
mhm mm
mm
in order to serve god
mm
yes
whereas jane sees that as unnatural
mm
yes like
wasn't it
that
a typical religion though that in that day and age when you were made to UNK yourself you were made the whole time to recognize your sin and anybody who was UNK inclined
yeah
was going to become a rivers
mm
yes
afraid so
and UNK it on others as
mm
well
as well
yeah
and be a UNK as well
you know van UNK er he had a hired woman and er he definitely thought that was what he should do to actually put all his UNK into his painting
mm
and
mm
and well he didn't mind
so it's best not to have
well that means freud accepts that is one channel in which
yes
any UNK sexual UNK will go
that's right
it goes into creative
UNK it
yes
isn't it
yes
yes
but erm rivers didn't exactly UNK it did he
i mean
no
evil came out of it
it was a and also was UNK on by his two sisters
mm
wasn't he
yes
although they recognized that jane's lot with him in i mean they wanted jane
oh yes
to marry him
mm
but once they knew it meant going to india
mm
and that she didn't care
mm
for him then erm they supported her
yes
oh yes but
well no they didn't
er they did UNK on him you know rather UNK
yes
but
it makes you wonder why
so i think when we have these
he was good looking
erm er UNK of er men you have to take i it that erm we could argue charlotte bronte was very critical of the men she knew and the men she thought she might know and didn't erm you have to look at the women who feed into the making of them
mm
don't you
as you say you have to look at mrs reed
that's right
and
mm
the making of john
and perhaps the sisters and the making of st john
mm
but the men had the power didn't they
they erm
yes
they had all the power
so women had well what else could they do but kind of
mm
well the women were UNK weren't they
in fact you know they just belonged
mm
to the men and
yes
either their fathers or their husbands
mm
yes
but mrs UNK children er three of them all a re a reflection of her UNK
mhm mm
mm
if you can put it like that
mm
mm
yes
cos the two er girls
mm
who are were extraordinary
mm
and they didn't fit into life did they
well
into the world
well one was to
no one became a UNK didn't she
yes
yes
one was to one should have married
st john UNK
yes
that's it yes
UNK and st john could have
bored each other rigid
yes
yes
erm
some
murdered each other actually
yes probably
and the one that was UNK
UNK
was
yes
completely useless
yes
absolutely hopeless
she was pretty
er she was pretty she was
er she'd been ruined hadn't
she was UNK
all UNK
yes
she went sort of she just sort of spread and got lazy didn't
yes
she
you know in everything she did er physically mentally you know
self UNK
yes
absolutely
er and john just went wild
mm
yes
i mean erm
what's your explanation for mrs reed wanting to see jane again
you know where she finds her
ah
that's an interesting question
i'm sure she went to heaven or thereabouts
yes
yes
yes
the UNK answer is to try and clear her conscience to tell
mm
her about this uncle
yes
who wanted to leave her money
yes that's a wasn't it
erm it's the go i mean you can or not er decided whether you're going to believe in a woman who is so UNK that she's going to allow them er prevent her having her UNK
mhm
erm legacy
mhm mm
erm because she is of an equal status
mm
with her own children
mm
mm
they are cousins
mm
mm
yes
erm and obviously the fact that she's sent to UNK shows that it's
mm
her UNK being pa paid for at the cheapest possible
mm
er rate
yes
by mrs reed
mm
and that's only because her husband were on a promise from her
mm
mm
erm i think it's er an original mark of the book that they don't make it up
no they don't
no
i don't think they should make it up
no
i think there are some UNK which cannot be UNK
mm
mm
and if charlotte bronte had reconciliation there i think it would have
oh
it would have been er awful
yes
wouldn't
yes
it
it would
and she
no she just turned away from her didn't
yes
she
she did
after she'd
it's a UNK confession to
mm
UNK her
yeah
her wrong doing
that's right
but no way did she have any affection for her then
oh well mrs UNK nasty
and UNK died UNK er
yeah
jane didn't she
she did anyhow
oh yes
so that was on her
mm
but it had served the purpose of making jane know about her
uncle
yes
didn't it
that's right
this uncle who was also presumably the uncle of er not only the UNK children but would he also have been the uncle of re mrs UNK
yes
children
yes
oh
yes
he would her brother's erm
mm
yes
husband's brother wasn't he
that's right
but he also gives you a feeling that she was trying to show the difference good and evil in other words jane refused to hate her but she did hate her
mm
mm
you know what i mean
yes
mm
all the way through
mm
hate gets you nowhere
yes she felt sorry for her
there is erm a victorian UNK convention also being slightly worked against here er if anybody knows david UNK novel nice work
yeah
mm
anybody know nice work
mm
erm features er a female university lecturer who's who says of the victorian novel that it comes out right by marriage er either marriage legacy or i can't remember what the other one was there were three categories
and jane certainly gets her legacy
yes
but she gets her legacy erm in order to be able to show that she doesn't need it
mm
mm
mm
in order to be able to not give
yes
it up you don't have to
no
give it up
but she did share it
but yo er she did share yes
yes
and to be able to if you like bring it as a UNK but it wouldn't have UNK if she hadn't a penny
yes
the UNK the same with helen huntingdon
oh yes
yes
quite
mm
and you may as well have it if it doesn't matter because
mm
then you can show as an author that it doesn't matter
mm
if you haven't got it then you could just er other people just could be nice when they marry you and say that it
doesn't matter that you haven't got it
mm
no
but if you've got it and it doesn't matter then you can really show it doesn't matter
and bearing in mind that anything that she had would automatically become UNK
mm
yes
yes
er you know because anything belonging to a wife belonged to her husband at that time
that's right
but he would also in the spirit of their marriage they
mm
they UNK everything didn't they
i mean it was obvious that it was going to be erm well i mean she'd been married she's married ten years
mm
by the time
er the book ends
yes
and this is a question that always occurs to me and i've read this novel several times at the end of it why did she write it
not why did charlotte bronte write it why does jane eyre write it
why does she write this story
do you think
because it's a long road from sad des UNK being UNK to true happiness
it's a love re really
yes
it is a love story
it's also a spiritual journey and a and a movement
it's this
to belonging and
journey of fulfilment isn't it
yes
having some
some fulfilment through UNK
yes
really
why would you need to write it if you'd had the journey
to get it out of yourself a
and UNK
to make the beginning
possibly yes
yes to erm rational well to erm explain the beginning you know to get the UNK and the erm sense of injustice out of your system
interest which is for er for the children
and also UNK
possibly
interest the children yes
UNK erm this to society what goes on in society
well
yes
we don't get any sense of jane actually publishing this do
no
we
no
or cross advertising either though
i've got no idea
mm
it's a UNK
but they UNK it didn't she
in the story for me
well why do people write their UNK
yes
exactly
yes
so that she wouldn't
yes
forget it
yes there's that
there are UNK there are UNK here and there where she goes into the present tense
mm
yes
oh yes
yes
yeah
and if it's as if she were writing a diary i decided
yes
that was the effect
it had on me
well more or less she talks to the reader and
she does talk to the reader yes
maybe
yes
she feels that the whole thing needs UNK and that she's just come co come to the pi the point where she can UNK everything for once in her life
yes
yes
and
yes
she doesn't also want to forget
yes
it
but then UNK did the same
same ending
and no
entirely
UNK ten years after er sitting there surrounded by her little ones
yes
erm and the man she loved
and she went through the same UNK got exactly the same ending
it could be telling the children all of it in fact
yes
it could be yes
mm
mm
i do i mean i'm asking you questions which i don't know the answer
yeah
there's a note here that the general confusion of dates and UNK and UNK and facts is even more UNK that anything UNK did
well of course
she couldn't have got the be because she wasn't yet twenty one
oh i see
is it UNK
yeah
she does seem to have quite a free hand for a woman under twenty one
mm
didn't she
mm
and UNK i assumed it's because she was UNK
it is really understandable
and you know if people don't care for you they aren't going to stop
no
you doing certain things
no
i mean in the last
don't you think
chapter she appeals to the reader i know i came from etcetera
yeah
so in the end she is
yes we can be
oh
just see if it's speaking to me
sometimes it just won't work
that nearly works and stick that under there
hear it
mhm
we hear it
we're saying nothing
now you just have to tell me about that peedie er shop again vera
i don't know that it was actually a shop
aha
but i think it would in fact you'd maybe find records of it in some of the old orkney boats
yeah
i'm sure that's where he got it
aha
and er it's it was just a i think a sort of supply of stuff was kept at certain houses
mhm
so that folk maybe in the sort of parish didn't have to walk into the village to get it
to get it
well
and it well they certainly seemed to be to do with it at the UNK like the linen
yeah
and then the UNK for the
aha
i suppose it would be when they well when they dressed that was the night they had a big celebration wasn't it
aye that would be it
mm
was that was that was the night or
no
yes that would the night when the body was put in the coffin
coffin
aye
yes
right
and a lot of the friends were asked to come
to come aha
aha
because i've had a look through all the books that there was and er there's never more than what
mhm
well you see
so it's something nobody knows much about what were like in orkney
but this actually came from thinking about shops
i see
and things that were sold you know in different places and this
mhm
small sort of shops that were well in UNK and
aha
mhm
and they would sell maybe the cloth
mhm
and the what else would they sell
well i don't know what else they had i think
ah
it was just more or less they certainly wouldn't have food or anything like that i think it was just more or less the supplier or that would be
aha
when relatives called you see
oh i see
and so that the folk wouldn't have to UNK into the to buy their stuff
no but you certainly nobody no woman ever went
when i was young
nobody
and in fact women weren't
mm
no
seen at funerals
oh is that right
yeah
the woman was never seen
they went into the either the upstairs room or the kitchen or somewhere the door was shut and that was them
oh i see so sort of on the funeral day they wouldn't even be in the house
oh no
no
and
and like when anybody died your blinds were taken down
oh i see
and maybe a relative or a near relative would do the same
mhm
i can
yes
mind being in here with blinds down
and always when a funeral come down the school road there's blinds would be taken down as well
as well as all
oh
the folk in sc on the school road
shops everything took their blinds down
a sign of respect i suppose was it not
yes a sign of respect i suppose
and what about UNK would they keep them in
oh yes
rather then
oh yes and you didn't get to go to school
i mean you were kept home
oh
oh is that right
yes
you stayed at home
i see
oh and you would you would just get a day off for the for the funeral if it was a near relative to you
would it be
yes but usually you were off school right from the person died to the to after the funeral
how long would that be
maybe three days
three or four days
mhm
three of four days
mhm
mhm just kind of
mhm
and then there's black clothes was worn
from top to toe
oh yes i've heard of it
i've heard of it
that was the one thing that was that i read in the books that it was kind of tradition for the men to wear black
mhm
oh but the women wore black too
yeah
and if you i mean if you maybe couldn't afford to buy a new UNK you would have a big black diamond cut off a piece of cloth
oh i see
and UNK on
oh
or an UNK but it was usually a black diamond here that was worn
really
mhm
aye and the women would wear maybe grey
mhm
after or a
mhm
mhm
aha and what about hats
would they have
oh well hats were worn
or would they
the funeral day they wore bowler hats
oh really
oh yes the men wore i can remember my father wearing a bowler hat
oh really
oh yes
and some of them may maybe the old women had a cap on but it was usually bowler hats
for heaven UNK bowler hats
that's just
that's with stiff white UNK and
oh yes
mhm
that's that would be a complete suit then really wouldn't it
and would it be just kept for funerals especially
oh well they usually had a dark suit
mhm
usually in a dark navy or
mhm so it would double as kind of a suit
oh yes
it they wouldn't have just special clothes for the funeral
no
no
the bowler hat was special
aha
the bowler hat
aha
yes i can imagine that would that would be special
it wo must have been i mean that was if you to get completely new clothes every time that would have been an amazing expense wouldn't it
oh no usually dark clothes
mhm
yeah
yeah
you know
ah
well i suppose that's still a bit true
yes
try and wear the dark clothes
oh yes
mm
yeah
mhm
so would it would it almost be two parts to a funeral then
a and a UNK
was it the both
oh yes
yes they don't now
no but
sometimes
well the undertaker
yes
oh no there's no
no report filed in like
mm
you see before there would be no women at the funeral so the women would maybe be
no
you know they would come actually at that rather than funeral day
mhm
aha
so what was the
what you call a wake
would that be the same
well yes something the same
mhm
mhm
so were folk actually invited to that before
really
yes
cos that's something that's completely
aha
changes and who were the invited
i read somewhere there was something called bidding
just
bids
near relations i suppose
aha
yes
and some would maybe just arrive if they thought they should be there
oh i suppose so
yeah
mhm
and would the minister be there too
no
no
no
that would
not at the
no
aha
that would just be the near relations then
mhm
mhm
mhm
the undertaker
and then they would all stay for tea or whatever
mm
yeah
mhm
so who would arrange for the funeral then
would it be that head of the family or the coffin maker
oh yes usually
aha
the undertaker
oh yes i mean
he maybe not
oh i think so i think they just you just contact the undertaker and he
mhm
he does everything else
yes
he does the main thing
cos i did hear on sanday that erm it was a joiner that made the coffin
and he was the joiner was the undertaker
well that's quite often the case
yes
aha
aha
and bill that was here he was the same
he made the UNK
yes but they don't do it now
no
no
oh i see they don't so i no i suppose they're bought
but it's still the joiner that's the undertaker
yeah
yes that's right
yeah
and it was er no it was a lady on sanday her dad had been the joiner there and she said that erm he acted as the funeral UNK as well
aye
he did so he actually organized the funeral
but i
mhm
thought that w couldn't have been normal
i was sure that it was usually the head of the family that organized that
well i don't know
well but it was UNK er i mean to say they told er the undertaker who they wanted
i see
at one time they'd say oh just bid the whole parish
aha
and they'd be written cards put out to everybody
oh i see not a funeral notice
yeah
oh no
no
funeral notice
oh i s oh really
that's
oh i see
aha
i think the first time i remember that i thought lord that just looked like a dance advertised through the window
yeah it does
yeah
that was
mhm
so i so there'd be there'd be written to and would it be special paper
well were posted
mhm
you know like there was always a boy that er went round the village
mhm
and just had the card with him
oh i see
and he had to be dressed in his sunday best when he went round
i see
and he just knocked on the door and you just came and you read the card and that was it
i mean you didn't get the card he just had the one card
i see
mhm
mhm
stewart doing that
so this official card would be passed round
mhm
so that's not so many years ago
no
really is that right
i never n that's changed
and would this card be a special black card or
oh yes
it was just a ordinary
aha just a aha
black edge on it
yes
a black edge
mhm
and you the wee envelopes that came in with the black UNK on them
oh yes
mhm
aha
i see and the boy that would be sent round would he be one of the family or related to any
no he would just be it would just be the undertaker would usually have somebody that did that
mhm
oh i see so
mhm
this was something they would
mhm
arrange
aha
i see i didn't realize funeral notices were that new
i just thought
ah well it's a good few years for this
well stewart still did it
mhm
but he would be the last of them in that did it
mhm
mhm
so was there a chap in that made UNK then
oh yes
at one time yes
oh yes
aha
and
bill
and
mhm
and UNK he do it for the whole of the island or just the was did the sort of parish have their own chap
oh no the whole lot
mhm
i see
whole island
mhm
oh yes
oh there's two
aye there's two
there's always two of everything
and what did they look like
were they cos i read this wife in sanday said that her dad covered the UNK in black material
so that you didn't
aha so they did
see the wood
mhm
yeah that was right
and i mind er mother the first time
yeah
it was material
UNK
and er i thought it was so bonny besides the black
yeah
mhm
so they were UNK covered here
mhm
and would erm the joiner do that himself then he would do everything
oh yes
yeah
and cover it was well
mhm
mhm
and then once i suppose he wouldn't make it in the house would he would have it made and brought to the house
no he would
aha
aha
mhm yeah
and then there would be the and then and while it would be while the f the coffin was in the house that it was it
aye that's right
oh yes i mean the wh the funeral day you would keep the blinds down that day too
mhm
yeah
so it would about four days
the next day they you went to nothing
mhm
you didn't go to dances or anything like that
yeah
and what about after the funeral day
did it relax more then
oh yes
or was there a sort of spell afterwards too
oh yes there would be you'd a year you would be supposed to be not very much
oh UNK oh right
oh yes you wouldn't be supposed to go to a dance or corn or anything like that
oh no
no
for about a year
aha
by that time somebody else had died
so you were
you wouldn't get
so you were in UNK just like the whole time
i can remember you wearing black forever
black UNK black stockings black
black hat
and mother died and then father j well mother died in nineteen forty and father died in nineteen forty one
and i can't mind what er what dates
mhm
i can't mind the dates
but it'll
was this the time you had your black UNK writing paper and black UNK envelopes and
no well i never that far but that was done and some would have the broad black
mhm
mhm
letters would come from in this broad black
oh is that right
mhm
mhm just to mark
you never see that now
oh no
no
no that's completely gone by the by yeah
folk seem to i don't know have a different attitude completely
UNK to funerals lying somewhere
used to get them sent
aye
yeah
somebody had one that
mhm
mhm
yeah
mhm
what about the service
would that take place in a church then or in the home
no in the house
in the house
aye the home
yeah
and
it was always the home
mhm and that would be the time then that the women would go upstairs or into the kitchen or
aye
aha
mhm
funny mind we were just speaking about funerals not that long ago and you were just saying like er you remember the when he died
oh yes aha
mhm
and i mean there was they walked to
mhm
it was a long UNK
that is a long UNK
aha
going from
and then it would just be well it would be a horse ca UNK then
aye yes
yes it was a horse
yes it would be pulled by horses
mhm
heaven UNK
and mother was the last that was in that UNK
was that right
mhm nineteen forty i don't think ever after that
aha
is that right
mm
yeah
aha
that field there
james 's
aye stood there and mind one halloween the boys took it and set it in front of 's door
aha
is that right
yes
they must have
oh
destroyed it
mhm
probably right enough
so would the coffin be carried out of the house then into the UNK
mhm
and that would be the ma well that would be the like the closest
yes
be like the UNK would do that
aha
aha
do you ever mind them walking carrying the coffin to the UNK
cos on a couple of islands
the walked with the coffin
yeah that used to be i've seen on film i've seen that you know like in UNK and places like that they carried the UNK
i suppose
aha
i suppose that's where they had no roads maybe or no UNK or something
no
no
there would always be a UNK
oh yes
was that a special cart then
oh yes
mhm
mhm
aha
special
just used for
it was c it was covered
wasn't it the UNK was covered in
yes it was just a
mhm
black coach you know with glass
something like a coach
oh i see
mhm
yes just like a coach
mhm
driven with horse driven
mhm
mhm
and would the undertaker drive it
no
it was always a
well it was somebody who could work horses i suppose
somebody well it was UNK that used to drive it
cos well i
ah
UNK
don't know why
i don't know but he used to drive it
that would be robert 's grandfather
oh heaven UNK yeah
i think he i think he drove it
mhm
mhm
so would this be just a this UNK be just a black cart with glass and then a UNK
be quite nobody would fit in it
or did
no there's just
yes
mhm
mhm
i see
yeah
mhm
and then it would be then would the mean follow the UNK
yes
yes
mhm
right to the UNK and then it would be
aha
it was a long day you know
yes it would be
some of them forgot to come back at night
they used to
oh i see
mhm
UNK
yes
and what times would funerals normally be
in an afternoon
i don't know
twelve o'clock usually
twelve o'clock
yes
twelve o'clock used to be a great well as far as i can remember
mhm
it was twelve o'clock the funeral was a usually at
i see
and now it's usually two
aha
that's right it's moved to the afternoon
well twelve before they walked the distance and got back again
aha
that's well that's right
they'd be following the cart so it would be going slow wouldn't it
yes
aha
mhm
and er the minister would be at the house
or would have to would he
was the minister at the house
whether he had to walk or whether i don't know
but he would be at the house anyway wouldn't he
oh sure
yeah
aha
and old mr our minister he used to by pony and trap
aha
but i remember he never had a trap or anything
mhm
mhm
yeah so he wouldn't have a UNK and then they would so it would start i suppose folk would start arriving at the house quite early in the morning
oh i would think so
mhm
and then they'd have the funeral at twelve and then they would walk
mhm
right
and then was did they come back for tea at the house
no that wasn't done then
i see
that's is that a new thing then
yes
er
mhm
i don't remember anybody coming back here
mhm
not
so the women weren't staying at home in the UNK to make things for or to back or anything
oh no there was nothing of the kind no
mhm
i see
and they wouldn't be in the UNK either
oh no
no
no
no
yes it'd be just be the men at the UNK
mhm
cos in apparently the women attended too
but i've
yes
yeah but i've never
yeah
attended as well
oh is that right
that the women went there
but
mhm
how long ago that was i don't know
mhm
they certainly went there long before they did down here
mhm
mhm
that's right
i see
and even still there's not an awful lot of women go to funerals here
no
you don't see it right enough
not really
and then but it was seen as okay that the men could go to the pub after a funeral
oh yes
er that was
mhm
aha
yeah
quite UNK
mhm
so that's quite interesting too
cos i wondered if funerals would wo have been seen as another sign of UNK
to have alcohol at it
but it doesn't seem to have been
oh no
and the wake would that always be the would that always be an evening thing
always an evening thing yes
yes
aha
aha
yeah
whereas the funerals was a whole day
aha
yeah
that's right
well that's we've got quite a lot that's brilliant
you see none of that's written down because nobody
no
knows that
no
er nobody knows that
did they have UNK in them days
oh that's the other thing i meant to ask
it was home made UNK
home made UNK
yeah the people what did they make them out of
well UNK
oh i see
oh i see
well if there was flowers in
aha
growing at that time it would have flowers stuck in
aha
but it was UNK i can mind mother making them
aha
oh really
oh yes i can mind mother
would it be UNK and wire and
well er just wire and they just laid UNK you know and one and just them and them and made a circle and a
aha
everyday stuck them in
oh yes
mhm
so would every family make a UNK if it was you know somebody c near them they'd make their own
oh yes
yes it was yes make a UNK you know and send
mhm
yes
oh heaven UNK cos that's that is a new thing plastic flowers
couldn't possibly have been there in the old days
oh no never saw any plastic flowers then
no
but when UNK you know was bonny white UNK you know
yes
mhm
and made a bonny UNK
mhm
aha
white on it
yeah
and just a small leaf on
and just a small leaf
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
i know they make UNK just like you're meaning in germany f at easter
aha
a woman i was staying with made a UNK like that
aha
specially for easter and it was just exactly like you said
aha
wire and she twisted them
twisted
lay on and twist it and lay on you know
aha
but it took her it used to take her quite a while i suppose it would take couple of hours to make a bonny UNK would it
mhm
yes it would
well i can mind us making a UNK at school when UNK died that was the only body i ever remember dying when i was at school
mhm
yeah
and we eight maybe took UNK and died
mhm
and i can remember we went and gathered UNK
UNK and UNK of UNK
mhm
and they were tiny and we tied them in wee UNK and it was miss who was the teacher then and she made a cross and put
oh how nice
ad we tied on these UNK on the cross
mhm
and we went away up to gather the UNK
heaven UNK
mhm
mhm
it's just been such it's obviously been a thing that affected the whole community
mhm
yes
that's what it seems that you don't it seems to affect the immediate folk and not many other folks nowadays
never wore anything but black from that day to the day she died
oh really
is that right
mhm
never had a colour on her again
heaven UNK
no
no that's erm quite
mhm
cos nowadays if you if you did something like that folk would say you'd gone a bit funny
mhm
they would say it's really affected you
mhm
colour again
mhm
yeah that's just that's sad really
mhm
very sad
yes that is interesting
the other thing i was wondering is about the grave UNK nowadays they're at the side of the grave ready aren't they
aha
after funerals
was that so in the old days do you know
or d
i've no idea about that what they did at the grave
yeah
cos you wouldn't be there you see
no
it wouldn't be wouldn't be done
mm
well i know they're not allowed to dig down like what they used to do
i mean before they went quite a depth down sometimes
be two layer down
yes well you see they're not allowed to do that
oh
cos you see and they could fall in
oh i see
there'd just be one of them there
but you see it's UNK new regulations and a lot of the UNK were on sandy ground and they'd be quite liable
mhm
to UNK in
yeah
so this is the that you're going over so much
otherwise they'd have had
oh i see
had this UNK up
mhm
always used to be sort of double depth down but they're not any longer
that's true
mhm
cos that's right it was quite traditional to put folk
mhm
UNK husband and wife and maybe
mhm
a UNK or something all in the one
mhm
that's right i mind that
well all this new the regulations are fairly new i think about
mhm
cos there wasn't a regulation afore about how deep they had to be
no
so or anything like that
i mind that right enough
yeah
well that is very interesting that's helped me a lot
a bit for the for the UNK
bits and pieces
bits and pieces
see if this grave UNK knows any more
i bet he won't know much more than that
i would think every community would have sort of customs of their own to a certain degree too wouldn't they
yeah
well this is that's what it says there too it UNK doesn't it say there it's different
yes
in orkney but nobody knows what was different
mhm
mhm
nobody knows what was normal and what was different
but if it's true about the women going to funerals in that's certainly different
yes
that's right
aha and maybe in
that's certainly a big difference
mhm
from what from what would be here
indeed
but that about the shops i never knew
that you might have shops for
mhm
for that things but i suppose right enough
that would be quite different
listen if that worked
good afternoon and welcome to on the record
we know what the conservative party thought of michael heseltine this week they UNK him to the echo when he UNK on to the platform at blackpool

john UNK returns from the UNK with answers to the questions you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask
but first michael heseltine
he's been a force in british politics for a third of a century but for how much longer
we've heard nothing from him for the past four months since that heart attack in italy
though the UNK have told us a great deal he's still far from well he might need a heart bypass he's gonna have to retire form politics
at the very least his influence over the party and british politics is at an end
well it didn't sound at all like any of that when i spoke to m mr heseltine near his home a couple of hours ago
i asked him first how are you
i'm well
er UNK as best as i understand what the doctors tell me er i'm er fine to carry the responsibilities and strain of er the cabinet job that i had
but you have to do it g slowly
take it a step at a time
it'd be crazy to sort of do a UNK in from the sort of UNK process
but er the er one of the doctors who looked inside my heart they put a local injection telescope upside he said i've got the arteries of a man of thirty or forty
don't UNK with him
don't UNK with him
so what does that mean
no need for a bypass
because they
no i just lost the tip of an artery
closed down finish
so there's it w it wasn't close to the heart
and so there's n the arteries themselves are very good
but this tip for reasons beyond my knowledge has gone so there's nothing to be done about it and erm er the last test i had the guy who conducted it said you've already got the heart off an average sixty year old who hasn't had a heart attack
and that sort of is very encouraging
so you're completely fit er
UNK yes
er but it takes time to recover from the er the shock and the experience and the UNK
but i've come a long way and er so i'll go back next er wednesday to the department and er if people will bear with me and put up with it er i'll take it er fairly slowly to start with but i dare say there will come a time when er erm you won't notice much difference
what you say the shock of it
what was it like
all of those of us who haven't had a heart attack live in fear of it obviously and think
yeah well i mean we all my father died of a heart attack
mm
and erm er that was a long time ago
i si think it's very possible that he wouldn't have erm died under today's
today
conditions
i had wonderful treatment in italy
i was very close to a hospital with a wonderful UNK er unit er where they had a professor who was one of the leading italian in the subject
i was there within an hour so i couldn't be more grateful and UNK
they're wonderful people the italians
er anyway that the but the actual experience er one knew something was wrong
i was not frightened i didn't think anything was that wrong
but i said to anne look i think you better get a doctor
this was before it happened or when it happened you didn't have sort of UNK that something was going to happen
well i you see it's all hindsight
i think in truth erm er we'd taken a weekend off and er to go to UNK there was a big er art exhibition on and anne wanted to see that
erm and i wasn't feeling on top form and er looking back i perhaps should have gone to a doctor then
but you don't you know
erm but th anyway there it was and er i had this pain not acute that's why i wasn't that worried
it didn't last that long
erm and from that moment i got into hospital and i had no more trouble
but i mean of course they plugged me up with all sorts of things
wi with of course one disastrous consequence
which er i mean damn the british media like all politicians do
one of the things they have to do is to get your UNK acid i think it's called erm content correct
and it so they give you some m medicine for that
a side effect of which can be that you can develop UNK
and so the what that
ah that explains
everybody saw was not the
mhm
fit UNK heseltine which i wished
you looked terrible
which i wished to UNK
but this sort of UNK
yes
you know UNK to the helicopter it was my
foot which had been had UNK
nothing to do with the heart at all
anyway UNK law you know
that's politics
but you did look you did look truly awful in that picture that appeared in the newspapers you looked as if
well my real UNK wrote and said michael you've got lovely legs
but did you think you were going to die
i mean was it
no i didn't
i mean i must be honest i did not feel that frightened erm it wasn't an acute pain that i mean i mean one of the things that one has to realize you can become a heart attack bore
very easily
everybody who's had any sort of UNK or experience or much worse they're all individual and it's no use me talking to you about my heart condition because you haven't got my heart
erm e they're all individual and mine i think looking back was erm er a light er experience and i mean as i've said the erm er w this telescope they shove up you er i mean chris UNK had the same thing
erm is local anaesthetic in the UNK
up goes the telescope you're lying there you know and the doctor told me he said do you wanna watch
do you wanna watch
and i said ah
you know
anything but
absolutely
but erm anyway that's it's all it's all now a few a few months ago
did it change your perspective on anything on life on politics on what you're doing in the job
well i suppose erm well i mean i remember er ludicrous really sort of thinking of what i would say at the tory party conference while i was lying in that hospital in UNK
and i actually made some notes
erm then
and er so i mean it's you know i am a politician i mean you know it's in the blood i've b been in the in the house of commons now for about a quarter of a century
over a quarter of a century most of it on the front bench
and erm i like it
but the fact is i mean i you know you do ask these questions your family make you ask these questions quite UNK
i there are other things i could do
i'm a UNK gardener and i that's what i've been doing
