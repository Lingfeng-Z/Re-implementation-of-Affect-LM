it has the difference if there is the implication that in many perhaps in most cases of aids it could have been avoided by what used to be called clean living
sure
yeah
mm
it's possible to get it whereas nobody can control i think UNK
no comment on peoples
no
no
but then if you think of those children that murdered that child
oh
that was awful
mm
i mean probably yo you know i don't know probably next year might not just be one case there might be two or three cases of that
i don't know
but probably something like this might turn people in the other direction
mm
it certainly erm sent a shock of horror though the whole country
yeah
yes
er whole country was for you know
so more mothers er with children are known to
brains
brains yeah
put the fear into parents from that point of view
it lasted for about a fortnight that didn't it
yeah
exactly
yes i mean it doesn't last long does it
no
no
no
they soon forget
they get nowhere if something else takes their mind and
yeah
like going to UNK or the people
doesn't happen to people who are most likely to be
a lady in one of the flats said there are still children playing about on their own
mm
yes
but then it's a shame that children can't play around on their own
i mean i did
yes
there was thi th the i think that this is this is
children's
this is the point behind all this discussion isn't it that erm we have reached a stage where certain things er we take for granted as being difficult as being frightening
yeah
as being dangerous
yeah
er twenty years ago certainly wouldn't have been taken for granted
no
no
erm i was talking to er a young man this morning
erm he was saying that his young boy of eight he doesn't allow to play out alone
he takes him to a football training course because he doesn't like to think that he goes to play football on the park
yeah
but twenty years ago he would have gone out himself at that age
yeah
yes quite
to go out and play football
so within twenty years there has been an enormous change
yeah
yes
erm i there's a very small example
i received an unexpected parcel in the post the other morning and my first thought was is this safe or not
is it a bomb
is it a bomb
i mean years ago that would never have occurred
i put it down and i phoned the people i thought might have been the UNK of it to make sure it was genuine
yeah
and they i suggested they should come and collect it and if i hadn't got a er a reasonable answer i would have phoned the police
yeah
now would you have done that five ten fifteen years ago
no
no
no
you would have picked up the parcel and you would have delivered it yourself
or you would have say taken it to the post office or something
yeah
but erm nowadays you i think we we've all got this idea that we have to
aware of
we're almost accepting that life is difficult
but it's just self defence
and it is self defence
mm
it is self defence
let's have a look at some of the closing questions erm before we run out of time and the UNK ready
about how long have erm we got
we we're doing alright
we're doing very well are we yes look at my peculiar watch yes
panic not
changes in social UNK are reflected in the current definition of family of black sheep and we haven't asked what the current erm definition of family of black sheep is
for example couples now live together and have children quite openly
why on the other hand there are UNK for UNK wives
has society modified it's conception of family and of black sheep or are these changes the outcome of a climate of UNK i think we've touched on this to some extent already by saying things have changed
i can answer this by a simple illustration in language
that what i always call a family is now referred to a lot a lot as a family
mm
mm
oh
a term which certainly i wouldn't have understood a few years ago
yes yeah
so that
i mean you can see in the mercury that night after night in the birth column
mm
er announcements where they give both UNK at the beginning
yeah
yes
yes
mm
what name does a child take in a case like that
mother's name i believe
yeah there's sometimes arguments
you see a rush of double UNK names now
yes
but it is i think automatically the mother's name is given to the child but it can be decided that the child takes the father's name
erm and the UNK and that the father's name can therefore appear on the birth certificate
so the child can be born to miss jones have a father called smith and the child can be either smith or jones
that's right
but once decided it has to stay with that until it gets
on the medical records it would go down under its mother's name but then records go down under another name
yes but there is
so there is there is a wider acceptance on the one hand of erm sort of freedom erm and i know we're back to this idea of sexual freedom but there is the violence within our society and the question probably is are those two connected as we give greater freedom on the one hand do we get a higher incidence of violence on the other hand
no i don't think you get a higher incidence
no i think this is where the society has definitely improved
mm
we are now won't accept domestic violence whereas it's always gone on
yes
yes
mm
and at the UNK wives UNK
mm
are a response to our objection to domestic violence
against women and children who against their lives
yeah
that is no longer acceptable
it used to be acceptable in the same way as incest
mm
yeah
which used to be common place
it
people haven't suddenly stopped ab sexually abusing their children
it wasn't even illegal until nineteen oh something
mm
that was accepted that the master of the house
yeah
did as he liked with the females of his
i was reminded of this the other night at a little theatre i forgotten it er when we were watching on the point of
oh yeah that yeah
yes
i mean
i've no idea but i imagine so yes
mm
mm
mm
so it's a it's a greater awareness rather than a greater for this
so i'm not at all sure that myself it is so much worse
i think things that which were accepted are no longer brought up
brought out in the open yes
so i suppose i'm talking now about er not crime you know vandalism but in the family situation
yes yeah
neither party will put up with a lot
mm
mm
but they used to
but i think it's also erm worth saying at this point that a the higher rate of divorce is perhaps an indication again
yeah
yes
people is not are not just opting out of marriage but they're not prepared to put up with the situation
no that's right
but years ago they would have put up with and said nothing
yeah
erm so you can't you must be careful not to draw the wrong conclusions from the figures that erm we were given
yeah
yeah
so the two are not necessarily connected
what about question number five then
you will be able to find other examples of family black sheep
i can't think of any
we have two in the in the distant past
yes yeah
can you with any of these characters see stages at which they might have been rescued and by what means
one of them
rescued from what
rescued from what
being a black sheep
well it's ra it's set the topic the study starts off by talking about the parable er of the er the UNK son and the UNK son was in these terms rescued
because the UNK son came back and stopped being a black sheep and became the accepted son again
well we don't
well we don't know
mm
we don't know
no we don't know
no we don't
might have just
might have gone off again
ah
we UNK him
yo you see i am i am the eternal UNK i think he came back and stayed
the eternal UNK would think that he came back and UNK off again you see
as a general point it's er a mistake i think to take the UNK
mm
and the UNK and pushed them too far
usually they expect to er or
yes
thought or expect to demonstrate one point
mm
mm
mm
erm the yes and it and it demonstrates a point and er you it's dangerous beyond to go beyond there yes yeah
unnatural
i don't think it i don't think i intended it to be UNK
erm i honestly though oh yes i can i think i can think of a black sheep
er it just occurred to my family
again i think it's a change of UNK
erm i have i think cousin erm who was in the air force during the war and came back from the air force with a child
i think in fact she had to leave the air force because she had a child
mm
er it UNK afterwards that the man she had married was not the father of the child
now she was the black sheep of the family
mm
er people went into corners and talked about her
i don't think she remains i don't think she remains the black sheep of the family because at attitudes have changed
yes
yeah
but there was a time when she was a sort of UNK
yes
erm and you know let's face it i didn't have to go through the circumstances that they went through in the war and there therefore who am i to judge
yeah
what did or did not happen at that time
er but certainly the there was in as i say in my family there was this there was well i mean i think perhaps she would be described as a black sheep
yes oh she would
erm in those days but i doubt if now anybody would
bother
bother about no
nobody
i tell you this today they would be a queue to marry her because she would get a hundred thousand pound for
yes indeed and we have one last
and a
one last question to think about then
can we UNK the number of family black sheep and still maintain the UNK of difference
why is it that the black sheep of the family is often the most UNK
yeah that's what i was going to say
yeah
yes
i think it's this idea that it's alright to go so far it's when you go over the top
erm it's alright being a naughty boy it's quite accepted that you are i'm using the UNK because i can speak from a male point of view i suppose
it's alright being the naughty boy in various senses but if you go over the top and you are no longer just naughty but even worse
it's alright as a man if you do certain things oh he's a bit of a lad
mm
yeah
mm
we tend to say that or used to say that
yes jack the lad
yeah
jack the lad
but then when it goes just a little bit further
then there is a UNK of acceptance and suddenly there is er almost UNK that steps in
mm
mm
erm and it can it can happen overnight can't it from some someone is er he's a bit of the one with the ladies
that is probably quite acceptable
yeah
yeah
well use it certainly used to be
but you go beyond that and it is not acceptable
no it's
being found out
being found out is the
it was alright to come to your marriage having been a bit of a one for the girls but it wasn't at all good to come to your marriage having been a bit of a one with the lads
absolutely yes
not quite a law for the rich and law for the poor
no
but certainly yes
yes indeed yes indeed
as a general principle i'm always rather attracted depends of course on your outlook on st UNK he
that you loved god did what you like
mm
but that of course only works if you are a particular
yes
how
any closing comments now before we stop and have a cup of tea
are you gonna round this off
it just occurred to me that i don't how many children mr and mrs thomas had but the only one who's remembered is UNK
yes
yes indeed yes yeah
and he was perhaps the black sheep
he was perhaps the black sheep
black wool sheep
right
that erm course work's gotta be in a week today
yes
what've you is er
i've got that other one to do yeah
what both sets of course work have gotta be in
mm
right in that case we'd better have a look at that now
is it in here
no it's in the other one
have you got the other one written up
yeah it's just that erm it's just got
right
yes
and that's all
lovely
next one
should have plenty of work there you should be okay
mm
with that
that one
which one are we going to do
can't remember
volumes or UNK
UNK supermarkets produced dried peas in sealed UNK bags contained in er stored in wire bins blah oh
was this one we were wanting to look at wasn't it
yeah
draw accurately and name six UNK with sides three four five six seven and eight and nine sides
three of these should be regular
mhm
okay
so y can you remember how to erm produce er UNK how to how to make them
how to make regular UNK
no
right
now a regular UNK where are we
something to write with
a regular UNK has all its sides and all its angles equal
mhm
so if you start with three that's
mm
a triangle isn't it
it's the smallest UNK you can make cos if you've got two sides you can't join it up can you
no
so you've three sides all equal length and all the angles have gotta be equal
now the triangle add ups to how many degrees
hundred and eighty
hundred and eighty
so if the three have gotta be equal you've a hundred and eighty divided by three which is sixty each
mhm
er and then the next one's four
now there are a lot of four sided ones really
mm
erm cos if you start thinking about the four sided ones there's the square which everybody knows about which is again is the regular UNK isn't it
mm
cos it's got all four sides equal and four ninety degrees
mhm
then if you can think about that as being stretched as it were
mm
you know keeping two of them fixed and the other two if you think about it being stretched you get a UNK don't you
mhm
a k a an UNK
but again
mm
it's not regular
no
but you can then think of that that's with the sides two sides stretched but still parallel to one another aren't they
yeah
now you c the UNK ninety
as soon as you destroy the ninety degree angle you get a UNK don't you
yeah
i'm gonna have to draw it there cos i wanted to like that
you get the UNK
yep
opposite sides parallel but the angles aren't the same any more
no
now if you think about going this way that was so keeping the angles constant at ninety wasn't it
mm
now this way you can keep the sides constant and destroy the angles
mm
and if you do that you end up with a UNK which is a UNK
mm
square
the four sides are the same length
mm
but the angles have gone
so that's a UNK
and that's your UNK except for this one of course
haven't finished yet with UNK
there's this one which
yeah
is the UNK
yeah
it's got pairs of equal sides
mm
but the two pairs of equal sides aren't opposite one another so you don't end up with the either the UNK
mm
or the UNK
if you think about this you can think of a UNK as two UNK triangles UNK together
mm
of different sizes
as you can think of a UNK as two UNK two same sized UNK
yeah
triangles UNK together
so it's line of UNK there and that isn't a line of UNK
okay
so there's your four
yeah
that's the regular one
you can get thr triangles UNK triangles right UNK triangle and
mm
UNK and so on
there's your four that's your UNK except of course for this one
any old size
mm
no angles the same no
mm
no lengths the same which is the UNK
which is the general one
all right
mm
now it is possible to draw these and the next one up is a UNK isn't it
can you remember
you've gotta remember these
you need to remember these anyway for your exam
mm
well if we're gonna draw a UNK it's easy enough we want five sides so everybody can draw a house end
mm
but it's not regular
no
you can also draw this and people tend to forget this one
oh by the way sorry there's another one here
i tend to forget it everybody else tends to forget it it's an arrow UNK or something like that is also a UNK
it's got four sides
mm
so you can UNK you can think about this
this is can happen here as well
mm
so you can actually get that's a UNK isn't it
five sides
mm
and you can stretch it and bend it wherever you want but that's th
mm
it's till a UNK isn't it
it is possible of course erm to you know draw a line er c you know UNK it like that
mm
but if you want to draw the regular one you can sit and do this backwards and work out what the angles are
but if you think all UNK can be drawn inside a circle
mm
so if you draw a circle you know you wanna split this up into five sides
mm
so a circle is three hundred and sixty degrees isn't it
so if you wanna split that up into five UNK you divide three hundred and sixty by five which gives you
seventy two
yeah
mm
seventy two degrees you want five sides
so if you start at the centre and draw a line and mark off seventy two degrees
mm
and then mark off another seventy two degrees and another seventy two degrees and another seventy two degrees and join the ends
yeah
you'll end up with a regular UNK
sorry
have you got
a UNK and protractor to hand
no
i can go and get one
i don't need wonderful drawing instruments but
no
no draw yourself a circle
oh
try one of those
right
okay
er put a line in from somewhere there from the centre up to there just to give yourself a start somewhere
mhm
just draw that in
straight line yeah use the edge of the UNK do
mhm
now draw yourself seventy two degrees from that
seventy two degrees seventy two seventy er all the way around
that's right
join each end there you end up with a UNK
just join them up and see what d'you get
alright
mm
you get a very nice UNK
mm
you can do the same thing for any of the others so however man many sides you want
mm
you divide three hundred and sixty by that number of sides which gives you this angle here the angle at the centre
cos you just dividing three UNK you just divide the three hundred and sixty up into seven eight or how many bits
mm
it is
you've got a slight problem with things like seven cos what's three hundred and sixty divided by seven
i don't know
yes i don't know either
fifty four point fifty one point four
fifty one point four
now if you're drawing fifty one point four
mm
you're going to have to erm
you know very
very careful with a protractor and the protractor you've got not it's not gonna really do a fifty one point
mm
four it's gonna be marginally out
mm
fifty one point five you'll f you'll manage
mm
reasonably particularly if you got a sharp pencil
so but six you can do
can you do can you do a UNK the other way which is six sided
s you could do you could do a UNK this way actually draw a UNK
do another circle
now it's gotta UNK got six sides hasn't it
mm
so you've gotta divide three hundred and sixty by six
what d'you come to
sixty
sixty
so if you need sixty just draw it and i'll show you you'll remember the other way when i've sho when i've shown you it
just draw that up
d'you remember drawing the flower pattern when you were a kid
no
eh
oh dear me
can you remember
oh yeah
yes
that's right just mark them off
now this is n not quite accurate because it doesn't quite go into it six times
it's just marginally off
but usually by the time you've taken in the errors of your UNK and your pr your pencil and everything else it come out to be fairly close to
do you remember doing that
yeah
that's right well that's in that's it
that's all it is
and then join 'em up
but it only works for that particular
mm
erm f figure for the UNK
it actually UNK it works for triangle you can do a triangle as well cos of course if you realize you can put a line across there a line across there a line
mm
across there UNK give you the UNK triangle
so you understand what you've got to do
you've only gotta pick out does it say three regular ones
three of these should
mm
be regular
i've gotta draw six UNK and then
yes
yes
right
so the first UNK a triangle
the next one's a UNK well is a UNK or a square or whatever it is
fifth one that one's a UNK
that's a UNK
mm
what's seven
s what do you call it
well that's the point
you've gotta know what you call it
i think it's a UNK
i think so
there's also people who call it a UNK as well september seventh
oh
you know that
that sort of thing
erm usually called a UNK
you're gonna have to look it up you're gonna find a
mm
erm maths dictionary or something somewhere
eight is the
erm the UNK isn't it
it's the UNK yes
and UNK a UNK
mm
well UNK non
yeah
mm
n o is actually the november is actually
mm
really the ninth month except they decided to stick a couple of m extra months in to get the twelve
it was originally september october november and december are seven eight nine ten
mm
really
cos that's why they d you know it's UNK
mm
UNK and UNK seven
mm
eight nine ten
but
yeah
they stuck a couple of months in the middle of the year
so that th instead of working properly
mm
they're now two out
right
UNK triangle as shown
find first by measurement and then by calculation the sum of the internal angles
er right
if you got some there's a UNK
it says divide 'em up
sum find first by measurement and then by calculation
right
okay
i'm gonna have to draw these with straight lines with a ruler it's not gonna work is it
can you draw one of these
draw a UNK with a with a ruler
doesn't matter what it looks like as long as it's got five sides that join together without gaps
so now you've gotta split it up into triangles by starting at one corner
mm
so pick a corner
mhm
mm
and split em up yeah
that'll do
draw a line so you produce triangles
you've already got one there haven't you
how many triangles have you got
three
you've got three haven't you
yeah
five sides three triangles
it wants the sum of the internal angles
now the UNK angle is that isn't it
mhm
and that and that and that and that
so can you measure those write UNK down and add them up
see how good you are at measuring UNK how good that protractor is
that one's sixty one isn't it
yeah sixty one
yes
that one's not far off ninety i think
smack on ninety
by UNK
er that's
well what's your just long as long as you stick that's it
one hundred and seven
yeah
next time i shall bring you a protractor that you can read
i bought i had one but i think someone nicked it
yes
it tends to be the fate of UNK
mm
hundred and five
yes i'd call that a hun i'd go along with that at a hundred and five
hundred and nine
hundred and nine all right then
just UNK 'em up and see what you what you the total comes to
four hundred and seventy two
four hundred and UNK eh
you sure
that must be more than sixty three
sixty one
measure that one again please
that's right
a hundred and twenty
that's more like it yes
that's much more like it
five hundred and thirty two
five hundred and thirty two
okay
now it says by calculation
now what do you know about the angles of a triangle
add up to a hundred and eighty degrees
add up to a hundred and eighty degrees
so you've got a hundred and eighty degrees there haven't you
you've got that one plus these two gives you a hundred and eighty
you've got a hundred and eighty degrees there haven't you
mm
cos these are these three add up to a hundred and eighty
and you've got a hundred and eighty degrees there
these three add up to a hundred and eighty
so all in all you've got ever angle covered here haven't you
mm
so it should come to three times one hundred and eighty
mm
which is
five hundred and forty
five hundred and forty
you're eight degrees out which is not bad considering this the rather poor nature of your erm protractor
so when you do this properly
mm
make sure you've got a reasonable size reasonable clear protractor
mm
and draw a reasonable sized diagram
now
mm
yeah
but of course the thing about it is that it works for any shape
mm
so no matter if you have and pick a corner
i'd rather pick this one because it makes life easier you can see
mm
because of this idea here
go like that like that and like that and you've got one two three four triangles
you should have six
mm
sides one two three four five six
mm
as long as you pick i if you pick your corner carefully
mm
you don't end up with problems
and if you draw your figure carefully as well if you did a erm
mm
a UNK like that with a going UNK rather than sticking UNK
mm
you'll erm you'll find you get nice easy
mm
erm triangles that come out of that
now then
that's doing it by measurement and tha and that's doing it by calculation ain't it
that's right that's doing by measurement and that's doing by UNK y actually i think dunno
my eyes aren't as good as yours but me glasses aren't bad
oh i can't no i can't see this on this protractor
no that's one of the problems
yeah
that's really one of the problems
get a decent one
about ten p
well they're at least l you know they're hardly the m greatest thing for breaking the bank
so are you happy with what you're supposed to do with this to produce these results
yeah
yes
that UNK that measurement and back up again
yeah
yeah
draw a graph draw a graph by plotting the internal angle sum which is the sum of the internal angles in this case five hundred and forty
mhm
on the vertical axis upwards
mm
the number of sides n on the horizontal axis
use your graph to find the sum of internal angles of an eleven sided blah and twelve sided
mm so you just carry it on do you
you just carry it on
mm
just carry the graph on
UNK a rule from your results so far that could be used to find the internal angle sum of a UNK with any number of sides
you should know now
how many triangles
three
how many sides
five
i rest my case
using your original UNK
mm
that the sum show using your original UNK that the sum of the external angles of a UNK is three hundred and sixty
mm
mm
now you think about walking round this
i've
mm
started along here i turn through that i walk along here i turn through that angle i walk along here i turn through that angle i walk along here i turn through that angle i walk along here and turn through that angle and i'm back where i started from
mm
now in fact of course you've gone round in a
circle
in a circle
a circle is three hundred and sixty
mm
degrees
mm
which of course is what you were doing here
mm
are you happy with that
does that give
mm
you a reasonable start
mm
go on tell me
mark this out in a table don't you
yes
so y the internal angles of the regular ones you can measure
mm
don't when you're doing this has six triangles in it hasn't it
mm
if you're doing it by calculation you pick one corner and draw tr
y
the other triangles
don't do this cos it doesn't work that way
you need to have picked one UNK and just draw
mm
the UNK from that UNK to the other ones
yeah
otherwise you end up with a some very strange results
mm
right
yep
that's that bit UNK
that's that bit UNK yes
just got that one to finish off
on the fourteenth
yeah i've got seven actually
seven or eight
i'll just go and get them
i've got them upstairs
right
yeah
that's right
yeah but you're as tidy as i am you are
come on then
that's nought
nought that's right
that's three
yes
six
yep
that's eight
what's the sum of those three
nine
nine that's better
and that's eight twelve
twelve is right
minus two
just write the minus two all the way across there cos it allows you to do the calculation much easier rather than trying to remember it
mm
so nought minus two
minus two
is good
well done
eh
oh beg your pardon yes sorry
you're right
seven
mhm
yeah
if you're gonna draw that graph up what will you have to do
put it down below
you'd have to put it below
that's right
mm
right now i don't wanna i'm gonna have to push you along a bit to erm make sure you get this done
so i don't you know whilst i would have normally if i'd been teaching a class done about five or six examples of that that's all you're gonna get
right
to start with anyway
so we're gonna up the UNK a bit
we've got x y equals x squared plus two x which is what i was talking about before
mm
we'll still do it the same
nought one two three four
mhm
we're gonna set it up again
we got x and nought one two three four but now to start the calculation we're going to put x squared in first
mm
so we've got x squared and then we're gonna put in two x
that term then that term
so nought squared
it's nought
it's nought
one squared
no
one times one
oh yeah one
one
be very careful with that cos it's very easy to do that
yeah
four
yep
six
nine
how many
nine
nine
twelve
no it's not twelve
don't do that
it's erm sixteen
it's sixteen
you must get over this business
mm
of thinking about it in those terms that way along
mm
that line
think about it from there to there
mm
what's the relation that to that not this to this
mm
it's really very erm bad this business
you know you got introduced to it when you were y very
mm
small and the things you first hear are the things you remember
mm
and it takes a terrible st struggle to get rid of it
okay so now we want two x
two
er two x
oh that's nought
it's nought good
s two
four
yes
six
six
eight
eight
and now we add 'em together
well i'll do the first one for you cos i can do that
yes
what's the next one
that's a two
three
three
eight
eight
fifteen
fifteen
erm
twenty four
mm
i'm the next one i'm gonna do i'm gonna spread it down below nought so we're getting into the negative numbers
but it w which will give you a better picture of this graph but we gonna have to get a chunk on this
i'm also gonna open this up a bit
one two three four
just for reasons that it'll draw better if i open it
i'm not gonna get it on
yeah you will
i'm not you know
gotta get up to thirteen er up to twenty four
oh right
i'm not gonna go that far
blah
we'll get enough from this
so nought is nought which is alright
one two three four
one is gonna be three isn't it
mm
which is there roughly
two is going to be eight
which is about there isn't it
mhm
three is gonna be fifteen
which is one of these days i'll do this on graph paper
i'll try fifteen rather than fourteen
what you've got is this
it's not a straight line
there's no way you can get a straight line through that
no
at all
so it's actually a curve like that
mm
yeah other side the same
it's called a UNK
that's only one half of the UNK
mm
so what we'll do is to gi y thing about this is you need the practice in actually UNK
yeah
the numbers
mm
so what we'll do is we'll have it's also actually equals x squared plus erm we'll make it three x minus no i'll not be i'll not be nasty
plus one
we're gonna go from minus three to three
mm
now again just in steps of one
don't
mm
you know try and get sometimes in an examination they'll give you funny numbers like two point five but they tend to work 'em out for you
mm
so you get things in there that have already been worked out for you so you don't have to erm so minus three
the next one will be minus two won't it
yeah
next one
minus one
minus one
nothing
nought
one
one
two and three
so now we're gonna work out x squared
what's x squared then
what's minus three times minus three
six innit
no
three threes are
nine
nine
yeah so minus times a minus is plus
mm
that'll be nine
that'll be four
two
and one
one
well UNK
yes nought
one
one
four
four
nine
nine
good
now it gets UNK
but you may whatever
mm
if you square a number you're gonna get a positive answer
it's gonna give you a plus every time
so if end up UNK a number and get a negative answer you've got it wrong
but now of course three times minus three is minus nine
mm
three times minus two is
minus six
minus six
minus three
three
nothing
mhm
three six
six
and nine
remember you're working from there to there
mhm
now we want a plus one
nine minus nine plus one
minus eight
no add em all up
add em all up
plus one
plus one is good
UNK minus three
minus
two
not two
si
four ones
four
five take away six is minus one
one yeah
minus one again
minus one
one
one
five
eleven
nineteen
mhm
you with that
yeah
happy
yeah
i've not gone too fast
no
good
that's okay
so now of course we want minus three to plus three so we want the axis down the middle
mm
don't we
and also we've gotta go down to minus one so we'll put it there and hope and pray we've got enough on this time
nought one two three minus one minus two minus three
oh
yeah
we'll put in minus one there
one two god is it that time three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
it's getting better
done it
got it on
right
minus three is at one isn't it
mhm
yeah
minus two is at minus one
minus one
mm
which is unfortunate the way we've got it numbered but that'll do
minus yes
yeah
m minus one is at minus one as well
mm
nought is at one
mm
one is at five
two is at eleven which is about there isn't it
mm
have i gone i've gone over slightly have i
never mind
and three is at nineteen
now the thing about this is look y this is alright you can get this curve in here
UNK down there and turn around so you can get through and get the curve
now when you get down to one you do not suddenly t put a straight line across there
mm
you carry the curve on round come back like that
mhm
so in fact one of the things that you cos usually you're given more points here so you can get a nice curve on both sides so you get a nice don't go from there to there straight across
mhm
cos you'll lose marks for that
you want a nice smooth curve
does it
mhm
yes
mm
we'll do other things but it's gotta be done with that later
but what i'll do is i'll set you some work on stuff you need to revise and so forth
and we shall
the english and not american english or german english and er this part of a massive project been undertaken from the british isles in suffolk it's already been to thomas UNK high school to report in lessons here a he decided to use the highway facility
i also welcome erm two of those staff into our proceedings people from the area and also of course from brandon i hope you enjoyed this morning's agenda
can i have your approval please for confirmation of the minutes paper t six five eight
agree
the agenda item number two is UNK
nothing really to add chairman to the agenda item of
just to point out to members that the promised report on the lorry management plan which is in the first preparation has been put back to the january committee meeting on the highways committee so that we can get full advantage from the traffic and
seminar which is to be held a week on saturday in ipswich from which we hope will er quite a bit by a way of input to the forthcoming lorry management plan thank you
thank you sir er move along please to agenda item number three which is the revised estimates paper please t six five nine there you are
all committees are receiving reports on this way on their revised estimate for nineteen ninety two three and the nineteen ninety three four budget as stated in section one of the report these are compiled to comply to the revenue guidelines issued to each service committee by the policy committee in september
section two there was a revised estimate for nineteen ninety two ninety three and there are two main points to mention firstly members will see that the revised estimates in total are less than the original estimates and this is because UNK interest rates have made it cheaper to service the outstanding debt from previous years' capital programmes
secondly the allowance for inflation was based on a three per cent price increase and because of the very competitive nature of the prices we receive for maintenance work a sum of two hundred and seventy thousand pounds can be carried forward into next year from this allowance in other words the real purchasing power of the budget have been maintained and two hundred and seventy thousand pounds can be put aside to stand in the future
section three deals with the nineteen ninety three ninety four revenue budget the main points for this year are that a similar saving on inflation in excess of two hundred thousand pounds can be put towards the extra items of expenditure listed in paragraph three point four that will fall to the committee's budget in nineteen ninety three ninety four in addition the savings generated by the UNK electricity maintenance contracts UNK another eighty two thousand pounds this leaves some two hundred and thirty thousand pounds of the extra commitments still to be financed
paragraph three point seven describe in some detail with a figure of five hundred and fifty thousand pounds will become available in nine nineteen ninety three ninety four when the rules change on the financing of structural maintenance on principal road this sum would be enough to cover the two hundred and thirty thousand pound short that we mentioned previously has to cover the loan charges to sustain the same level of capital programme on schemes not UNK by transport supplementary branch in nineteen ninety three four as is currently being spent in this year
the use of this five hundred and fifty thousand pounds is UNK on the policy committee's approval and the decision on this will be taken in january nineteen ninety three when the final standard spending assessment was known to the county council chairman the recommendations i can claim reception for and the detailed budget UNK are attached to the pending here
yes thank you a few things from our point of view is er three point eight i'm sure the policy will be well looked over by our friend comments by members have to make please
mr
shall i stand
why not yes
yes i'm used to it
right
erm on appendix b erm there is an item which erm members of the committee erm will know about very well it's the laboratory services that we give and have a great relate to them erm the item goes under seven i believe the figures there have dropped is that because we'd had a successful income erm there we've got a hundred and ten thousand for both up ninety two and ninety three and ninety sorry ninety two three and ninety three ninety four is it that er could we know or are we UNK that we're going to get a nice income because we have been told in earlier reports that this is quite a good slice of income to us and those figures are amended accordingly is that right
the predicted turnover for ninety three ninety four is slightly down on the ninety two three to the said market conditions
but have we got income as a result of the work the UNK do
the income er the laboratory you can see last year ma made a UNK of seventy five thousand pounds the budgetary purchases we always assume the laboratory will simply cover its expenditure in reality we hope they will be slightly better than that and they generally do
chairman i'm sure that the policy committee will take note of er your erm remarks er and indeed will be pleased to see the satisfactory er operation of the highways department er in the current year erm sometimes we get some better news than others and of course the fact that the interest rates have er fallen has considerably er erm assisted the highways department as indeed have the er very competitive prices which have been received for er UNK works
i really would like to comment further but i'm not able so to do er we have all heard the autumn statement er from the chancellor of the exchequer last week following on from that we expect to receive the draft standard spending assessment for suffolk on or about the twenty sixth of this month er and it really is will be er when we have that indication that er policy committee will give to er pull together the UNK for the preparation of next year's budget
thank you
and of course you won't proceed in the
of course until december so at least still very much up in the air but certainly the estimates of the current year are produced of highly
any other comments
yes mrs
thank you chairman on the recommendation four one three erm it says the same standard of service erm i imagine that's the minimum of exceptional level of service i mean it's sad that no longer do we ever talk about
say any comments
if not can we accept the recommendation of read out four one etcetera all agreed
mm
before we move on to the next agenda could we find some more seats for the people six more chairs get them together say if you want to stand
chairman while you're out of
can we then move on please to
agenda number four
okay thank you john
this report highlights the main issues which will affect this committee in the period during nineteen ninety three and nineteen ninety six section one UNK the desire of the committee that it would like as a minimum to sustain the whole of the revenue service and the similar volume of capital payments in the period of the medium term plan as is being divided in this year
section two describes the two factors which will need UNK in this period to achieve this objective these are the usual annual commitments and the need under the present rules laid down by policy committee to commence from the highways project the loan charges on the capital expenditure over and above the figure included in the transport supplementary grant settlement that is the two point seven million pound figure in paragraph two one b
the service power to view UNK view was that the three point nine million pounds was effectively a minimum UNK level and it was within this figure they required the one point six million on minor works and UNK to be increased to two million pounds for nineteen ninety three ninety four section three concludes that it will not be appropriate to attempt to finance these extra loan charges on a continuing basis on the fixed revenue budget as they would each year and on an UNK basis consume some three hundred and fifty thousand pounds
this would therefore reduce the amount available for revenue maintenance works
section four sets out additional areas that the service party and view panel regarded as pressure points on our existing budget and to which any additional sources would be applied if they were received
the recommendations are contained in section five and five one c effectively impress the assistance of policy committee in addressing the need to sustain at least the current level of spending of three point nine million on these small but vital schemes throughout the period of the medium term plan
that's quite a
chairman i am and some of my colleagues a little confused on this paper erm and i really ask that i understood that when we discussed this last erm that the minor work which was one debated erm was going to be increased to two million and that two million er two million spend was going to come out of the existing budget i'm not quite sure from this whether it is or it isn't could you explain
the er yes the er panel we discussed this and we the appendix say actually shows the current level of service being provided in ninety two three which forms the minimum of the ceiling of the three point nine million
when the service review panel meets in february after the budget decisions that have been made after t s g settled is known that then panel will really decide the ninety three four category programme and quite clearly two million pound will have to be inserted at that stage for demand of the
are you talking about inserted or added
erm inserted at the moment added if we its various other decisions come about if improved our capital er capital prospects
i'm still confused
chairman can you help me
chairman of the
panel recommended an increase in expenditure on this item of work next year an increase in one point six million pounds to two million pounds we can't say UNK that will happen until we've had our allocations both sanctions borrowing for next year it is a wish of interest of hands make clear in the comments on appendix a in this paper against the figure of one points being UNK that the
panel seeks to make that two million pounds subject to the appropriate level of grants and borrow approvals and perhaps some assistance from within our own resources and elsewhere being budget this is a firm intention to increase that figure but we cannot say it has been increased yet to do so will be premature but that i ask the committee to accept it this morning as a recommendation from the
panel it will then go as a figure two million pounds in the budget decide
i'm still confused
sorry i'm working from
is that until we get the final figures final settlements it's very difficult for them to put actual the budget figures but we can still actually come back at those in february and find what the
panel wanted doesn't that count should the highway committee itself wish that to happen
thank you councillor
i'm sure
but erm in effect we're talking about a minimum figure aren't we of one six
one six that's what it was but we're actually saying that's increased to two million in ninety three ninety four
yeah
chairman
all this all this very much depends chairman on the er t s g settlement and the a c gs what's an a c g
er approved credit guideline
that's it an approved credit guideline and er that is the problem at the moment that the approved er credit guideline for the non t s g schemes is really insufficient and is having to be UNK up er from elsewhere within the budget your chairman yesterday met with the er gentleman er the suited gentleman from UNK and er having er given them appropriate cups of coffee er impressed upon them that the er the one point two was really insufficient for one or two million er credit approvals was really insufficient for the needs of suffolk and er they went away did they not chairman saying that they er appreciated the point whether you had success or not or perhaps to er wait until december
chairman
that's how far as they would actually go at yesterday's meeting but er i thought that in civil service er terminology that was er
mr sorry do say do say
yeah i'm none the less we have got the comments of three in front of us and we see that the accumulate effect was going to be dangerous in the extreme if the money is not forthcoming
yes
and erm it is therefore in those circumstances UNK in my opinion to carry on with the british assessment programme at the present rate when the effects on our roads are likely to be so drastic
yeah
and it's quite simple er at the government level to be a capital approval between those two headings
yeah
and er it must be borne in upon them that the alternative for us are not having money to keep up our roads programme is going to be very dangerous therefore i think there is no question that the recent test programme is the second priority for concern
for in fact i as i said i'm glad you made that point it does press upon the er people in UNK yesterday in as not as well as that there's point in that er there was some
because of that though
upon this i do assure you
thank you very much
if i can take
any other comments members wish to make on
yeah i
sorry
i understand the confusion of going of going through to
but there's very well confused about the increase er regarded that when your foot UNK forward cos i think that's been er been very essential really the standard of footpaths in charge of the roads and areas these day and er to spend money on that with great move
yes UNK list in this area of our services have for have widespread support for
can i then ask you to approve the
as laid out and er having marked mrs card in terms of UNK whether it is thank you very much indeed
take it on our piece of paper t six one we draw breath here are you ready to go
yes mr chairman
right off you go
er this report sets out the approval of the committee a revised summary service plan that would ultimately be included in the medium term plan document that will be issued in march nineteen ninety three
the changes in the summary service plan in the previous meeting approved by this committee in june are highlighted in section two mr and mr will answer any questions on this aspect
section three is a UNK bid UNK to the three per cent revenue development requested by UNK committee and all committees earlier this year
appendix b has been UNK by using the various assumptions contained in paragraph three four two
in essence whereas the submission in june exceeded the three per cent limit this revision now falls within the guideline this is partly due to the use of the savings in the nineteen ninety three ninety four budget exercise and the reduce to be
for the capital enhancement
the assumption is made the policy committee will allow the five hundred and fifty thousand mentioned in the budget before to be retained within the high rate budget
if this happens some two hundred and nineteen thousand will be available within the medium term plan period if the three per cent was allowed to contribute towards the items listed in appendix b previous paper chairman the recommendations are contained in section b
chairman i'd just like to vote this man's attention for one brief minute on appendix a er the situation UNK from the work that will go into the highways committee service plan
first of all paragraph one point two er just pointing out that our members who already reminded but our customers are not just the residents of suffolk but those who actually use the trunk and the county road in
in suffolk and that's the important difference and probably treble the customer base with the highway service compared to other services in the county council
paragraph one point four legislation figures prominent in here and mr legislation of course is currently a changing scheme in our service and perhaps the most important new act for several years is the new road and street works act which is scheduled to be in action on the first of january next year and this will have two main effects for us firstly the local highway authority that is ourselves in suffolk will be in a far stronger position to manage or influence or control the work of public utilities in public highways
i hope that delays will be reduced and therefore cost reduced money UNK customers up there unless it can be
to road users
second point is the price to pay will be a sharp increase i fear in the administration of this new law the approval of street works particularly carried out by public utilities will be required an increased demand upon our UNK resources
paragraph three the action plan er well it will guide itself evidence this the statements made under the action plan from section three of the report will guide our activities over the next three years and of course paragraph four performance the critical success factors by the seven criteria we will be judged in the highway service and each one is a challenge in its own right and i do hope to receive in order to carry out these er these er promises in fact that erm i'd be given the relevant level of financial staff and resources
thank you chairman
i think when we slim down the suffolk
will be available which i take the word
erm so that's quite helpful also i believe that er the actual cost of this seems to be servicing met by the
hopefully to a large degree there will be money coming UNK to the local authority the local highway authority in the future the UNK of the inspection of public utilities works on the acceptance UNK er so there will be sort of additional income to help erm finance any additional starting resources and required to erm
mr chairman the
across a lot of papers but in this paper it starts er and as mr just said it starts as far as UNK erm do we know at this time or can we be informed as soon as were informed where of what whether implement are erm like are restricted by the chancellor's statement do we know or are have we gotta wait
no er i think it would be wise to separate the provision for UNK from pay awards they are quite separate er items of expenditure the UNK i refer to here these are the annual UNK which the county council as an employers contract to take an individual as he addresses through his particular salary rate will that
to the chancellor's announcement referred to pay awards in the public sector in their UNK not to relate in any way to the UNK or amount of UNK
i think that would be a great assurance to the people that we employ because many of them do get UNK
i can confirm that chairman there are currently no proposals to er restrict the UNK of progression
okay i think in fact the balance with the UNK of two one nine will be something to er enquire by the
panel and for concern and comments meant for
thank you chairman yes erm i know this in little be that erm that er rejected as shown as an achievement of an acceptable level provision while it
worked in er title which you just dealt with six five nine
yes
er four e we said er in that recommendation at least two million on minor work on UNK meaning that er two million was by no means what we needed to spend erm is it in fact regarded from a point of view of UNK seeing this paper and our recommendations that er acceptable is a more UNK word to put in there rather than increase er as increase likely to cause certain principal in the present erm economic employment
er i'm not really quite sure that UNK take that sort of really interest in our affairs actually certainly based on those
i'd be very surprised if er
yeah er if that's the case then i think we will increase what we're doing there in line with six five nine er four
aren't we all
four one e we say
four one e
yeah on page six one on page six five nine which we've already approved
b
four one e
six five nine four one eight
what paper are you on
six five nine
the
which referred to previous paper page six five nine will be
four one e
oh
oh we said at least two
right so the
we're making
yes erm obviously not made it very well but erm but the word acceptable ought to be altered to increased
where
where
it'll be in the performance er erm backwards
this is page four
we're now back to the page that we were on which is six one
oh four one b
four one little b
councillor i'm sorry you've lost me what are you actually referring to
that's a five
chapter first please
that's a five
alright read it it's around five and er
which paper
on six one
six one
if i were currently
four one v not b it's four one v
five
five
don't demonstrate it please
what we seem what we seem to be doing is increase the provision
that's what you're saying
that's right yeah right erm
away you go
three two little b the same level of capital payments on non t s g assisted schemes would've done erm exactly what are these schemes
and when does the highways committee decide the order of priority of erm undertaking these schemes
mm
which i UNK is our duty to do
alright just suppose that councillor are
five four one five he's asking you
be changed increased alright
are there any problems upon that suggestion
can we dispose of that out of the way
we agreed that as we are in fact we are keen on recent minor works programme by an increase
which we agree upon that agreed upon that one
thank you very much i'm delighted
councillor now we dispose of your point which three two and b and the question you're asking
yes my chairman
the question you're asking is when do we decide our priorities
priorities are decided as part of the january cycle which introduce at the local budget
chairman the mechanism is well UNK and widely known it starts with the draft two b in the january the committee and after a period of about five to six months' consultation within which the board programme of work of all UNK are listed and put out to the community for response through their elected organization as to UNK five points of detail who were at relatively UNK one man to speak
another is normally then referred back within the t b and also with the year the middle of the july committee every year we report on schedule and minor improvement propose for the accounted year and the following year when members can see each individual scheme which is under preparation and is UNK in their lovely er their order of construction
will these include the ones of each held this year last year that haven't been undertaken
yes naturally yes
as far as consultation of process of course i mean endless of how it can be
sit in on the public
just quickly
yes chairman er under four one six performance i think that we shouldn't er allow this occasion pass without UNK the work of our road safety officers where we talk about the reduction of accidents in accordance with
we have extremely good erm figure on a reduction in accident over the last few years and i'd like to erm i'd like councillor to erm to UNK our thanks to the road safety officers
er perhaps do that
in the comments
can we accept the recommendation as laid out on the first page of the
is that agreed
thank you very much indeed can we move on to the
er chairman before we go on could we conduct the experiment could we actually shut that see if the noise goes
yes it is a bit of a deterrent
a gentleman already closed one here
the paper and this report introduces the draft version of the highly transportation from it with consultation of organization down in the business some whom are listed in section two
now when it's finally approved the highway and transportation from it will be UNK as a specific service provision within the name suffolk
now they say UNK the said document for you this morning
before it goes out front page and the fifteen promises will no doubt will be noted by all who have an interest in our service
the chairman councillor
assure that none of these fifteen commitments will be used in evidence against us er i'm not gonna
the documents
evidence er i would however like to point out this isn't included into the report but much of these have these days that incidence of complaints received er by organization such as ours from the general public and i'm happy to report this indeed can be UNK that the incidence of complaint against the highway service has dropped off enormously in the last two or three years certainly within the last two years when we concentrated so much of our time and effort and improved in the quality and UNK of the service of practice er the level of complaints these days and these are general complaints not
to the banks not complaints directed to the wrong people general complaints we are running now approximately perhaps even less than one per week which is a tremendous improvement on about two or three years ago
can i ask a question please who will determine what is the most important work which is part of our promise list
er
that's my point chairman
i'm UNK
mine too mine too
yes
we are we are referring to promise number thirteen in order to say you can on the thirteen it's the second page third up from the bottom we promise to repair UNK that are considered dangerous in the most important roads within twenty four hours of application
i have to tell the survey that er ten days ago i reported a very deep UNK in a most important road
i can i can tell you that this morning that the UNK is not only there it's full of water so you can't actually see it but the point is it's doctor UNK lane
i know well
which is actually taken in significant of all of you but it's the most important road to me that's the point i make erm and so that a i think the wording in promise thirteen wants looking at
the general point here and i want to make is that er these aren't UNK promises these are the members' promises and er erm we've got to be careful that er when they're all drawn together that we aren't making a UNK fortune erm and so that i think it is very important members take aboard er what is suggested and test them themselves to see that they are realistic i would also say that er as these promises are being considered by the various committees and i note a considerable variation in standards which will need to be addressed when the promises er have come back to the policy committee these are particularly in reference to the time required to respond to er erm complaints etc it's no use having the highways committee wanting two weeks and incidentally on promise number two erm i think that er any up somebody else's point er straight forward wants to be deleted erm the highways require two weeks to respond er erm hearts and libraries want a you know half a day er and we've got to get these er erm more or less UNK i think and whilst i'm thinking chairman on the last page er of the er favourite for first for agent authorities but it doesn't give any indication about the contact point and as most of our population live in the agent authorities that the er it needs to be expanded to give the contacts er points for the members of the public
very good
chairman the last one first i fully accept the defence er request that er the telephone numbers contact points and names for our three agent authorities are necessary and make
this will be provided in amount similar to that the information provided for officers of the main organization
chairman i was delighted to hear mr and our members with the comments it was not just an officer from the members' comments as well and i hope we can work together in fulfilling these promises what are the most important roads
er not defining this particular document you find elsewhere the most important roads are i hope you will agree the roads where the traffic volume the traffic
are greatest and where the greatest problem there are or er exist under normal circumstances to which the trunk roads the a roads the primary roads the principle roads these roads are where the traffic is greatest and this therefore UNK in my mind at least the most important roads i think your correct term we will er consider the phraseology used in perhaps more accurately to described the title road which we are talking about here but i certainly take the point you make
and on that i think we have highways service promises not highways appointment
er yes mr chairman i mean i assume this thing gives us a fairly UNK stage i hope it's not intended in any way as a finished article it seems to me in many cases er a state into the obvious er i'd hope that our employees would be polite people erm you know this is a great step forward to putting down on a paper i don't know but i mean
just this mixture of ambiguity and UNK i think when we talk about the provision of an acceptable level of public transport i mean it's acceptable to whom for heavens sake
surely we should UNK this up a bit and say i mean i'm probably getting
a fortune or something but just say that er a co a level of public transport corresponding to the needs possibly even the aspirations to the people of suffolk so the emphasis is on you know cer you know putting people first i think is the county council UNK erm what do i accept from the members service
well it might be as it is might be as it was you know who knows
erm i think it would be nice if the grammar were checked from we promised to give high priority in responding surely we can give priority to responding and as a small point i was gonna go on about the most important road which of course is UNK street
erm but i think the whole thing needs looking at again er and UNK up made a little bit more convenient and i hope that er i hope that you can do this and this that this will not be our last opportunity within this document
mr do you want to come in
mr chairman i'm a little bit concerned about er number two er there's something that is we promised to reply straightforward written enquiry with without sort of commenting on whether it's two weeks two days or whatever i am a little concerned that some of the replies people show me that have had from highways department erm they really whoever writes them don't go into any detail i've had i've seen letters recently where somebody said it will be dealt with in about four weeks' time well that's okay maybe they've good and valid reasons why about four weeks is about right for their particular problem but they don't know why it's gonna take four weeks they say oh god they should be able to do that in a couple of days there's no problem it's an easy little job i feel that the our officers when they reply they should give some amount of detail and if they give a time span in which they're gonna put something right they should say why it's gonna take that long
mr
mr chairman two points i want to make and er i get i can link where the words can go on the top where under the leadership of county er survey and the la at the end of that last paragraph
this document is nice and clear plain english but quite frankly some of the replies and some of the er things understood by the public can we ensure that we do use plain english i've got no criticism with this is okay but when we get the replies to our customers erm that we service can we use plain english that's my first point do you want to respond or can i make my second one
no carry on carry on
the second point is that i've the americans i it's one of the promises about street life in second from the bottom two weeks in the winter four weeks in the summer well i know to my cost erm through my ear being UNK which is why you're a county councillor anyway that it's been six weeks at the present time we've had a lot of lights going down okay we're trying to improve it we had people walking into cars er a few burglaries which i'm pleased to say the police have helped out in but if we're going to change and get it down from a level of six weeks to two weeks as it is in the area i represent is that not a question of putting extra resources in it and there's no good putting promises unless we can deliver
okay erm is that we want to respond at are you sure those UNK are county council ones and not your farm house ones
no they are county council lights we couldn't afford it if there was too many of them
chairman with the with the
performing of street lighting er equipment has to be conducted on site of basis we have a system of UNK the whole county is covered by paid scouts who every so often do a tour of their big network of units to ensure that there is now one has to allow within the response time for the next cycle of
inspection to proceed that's why were partial explanation and i have the english to explain that for you
the main explanation why so long to reply is very much geared to the fact that we are in the hands of the electricity board for everything below the junction box on the street UNK column if the bolt is in the cable or a cable junction or in a circuit we are in the hands in another organization totally who will have their own UNK and priority to responses
but it isn't easy we have a lot what complaints we get bearing in mind what i said a short while ago what complaints we get now are very much biased towards UNK in street lighting systems provided currently here and there in suffolk so i'm conscious of this we are working with the eastern electricity board on an improved maintenance contract whereby certain benefits and one of them is UNK of response to repair work will be i hope put forward very conscious of it indeed so and er we are struggling with what the basic cause of it all of course is the quality of some of our street light and equipment here and there throughout suffolk is old or very out of date and even run down indicator procedure so we have got a large real programme as well as repairing ones already there
then on the question of consistency across the services my colleague chief officers and i are very conscious of the fact that we should endeavour to get just as mr suggests some er cross service er erm common response time for various points raised
it is i would suggest much easier to respond to the complaint in the line of service sir than it is in one round more complex technical services with contractors and sub contractors and the like with whom we've had to deal so there is that to be borne in mind as well erm i think i know about some of the response to be responded to that but it does generally valuable this talk this discussion cos it does show the degree of viability of UNK the service to your making problems of this nature it immediately challenges people to come back and say what about it you promised this you promised that and you're not performing this is discussion is a live example of the
mr chairman we did tackle very successfully er under utilities where we employ an extra couple of officers i even asked the question at for county council what was going on we i think we've got something further on the agenda elsewhere where we're trying to keep our stand standards up but i still feel that if we're going to be able to deliver a promise we've got to deliver it if it means monitoring the erm utilities then i think we should do it
yeah but we have given a promise to it
mr chairman
small point that's the whole point i think er miss was coming in
erm
well mr chairman i was erm referring to
oh fine
presumably mr was also talking about
would you let miss
i used the UNK an awful lot and defence of the highway department i have no complaint on that whatsoever about the street lighting i think it's very good thank you right
very good
miss
now then i was going to ask one simple question and that is has anyone thought about keep sending postcards to people er if the erm reply is going to be delayed in any way because at least then the person if there's sufficiently good reference will be able to phone up and say look you know yes i'm not happy it seems to me that would be a way forward on that erm
i think it was a moment ago
no but i think that's something that is
yeah
necessary
acknowledge cards has been in use for some months now just that
yes that seems to me to fit that sort of bill erm to be quite honest i would prefer that we base the promises on a previous paper that t six one er you know sort of er typical success of the fact looking forward cos at least erm that's not so erm you know sort of difficult to erm you know achieve as erm sort of repairing UNK within when you consider that the reason that the UNK don't get UNK is because government legislation has it that we have to actually erm have lines painted all round them so that they can be part of the package of er road UNK in many cases i mean urgently erm difficult ones are not that common er so i think that perhaps some of these promises are so difficult because it gives with one hand and takes back with the other you know it says we promise but i would say that's not much of a promise you say i promise to erm you know erm merge i forgot about but if it said but you know if it UNK i won't tell you er it would be very sad
what
i think that's a very real to have a very real er need to have promises with no UNK about
why forgive me one of the promises here is we promise to make it county wide twenty four hours call out service for attending emergency highway works and that's a promise
fair enough that's
that is one and many of these say erm we promise to treat all personal callers UNK and those with an appointment will be seen without delay well it means that the others will have a delay so it you know it's really difficult
chairman i think none of this is meant as criticism so i don't think you need to get too UNK about it it's a huge step forward having undertaken of this of this er the
there's basically three points that the public worry about one is certainly the UNK situation and if we take er mr assurance that they are categories of roads that will be dealt with in priority i think we also then need to spell out those various categories within our promise er because in mr place example his UNK is just as important to him or indeed to a UNK going along that little lane going into the UNK as on a front road so i think we need to clarify those er categories
the second point is on correspondence i'm absolutely certain that when a member of public writes in to any department not necessarily highway he expects and needs an immediate response now i know you have you have started the acknowledgement of our system but i think it's it doesn't go far enough an acknowledgement card that simply says the thing is received and is receiving attention needs to then indicate the individual to whom that matter has been passed for attention and that leads me to the third point and i think the general complaint on the public is that local government is seen as UNK people and i think we have to get in our mind to name people within our department there's not one mention about it in our promise i think we need unless i've not read it but i think i think we yes but i think we need to mention people by name senior people within the department who will respond to particular things and certainly where public comes into contact within the offices we must get around to wearing a name badge who says who that person is people want to relate to a person and i think we can do that if we try
yes well just a UNK just to show to my earlier comments i think this undertaking about street lighting will be met with some clarity over wide areas of suffolk which have never seen a street light er as far as i can recall the last figures i saw on this suggested that if we were to er carry out all the work that er parish is required it would take forty years to er meet the er thing so perhaps it would be UNK for when this promise is acting on the
delivered from a maternity hospital so the UNK can have something to look forward to in
well in terms of
it really is taking the
i'm sorry sir
councillor how many separate ones
three
thank you chairman as er members will know there's an experiment at felixstowe where a few local members and the
of the sub committee went down to hear actual objectors to er transport UNK that was so successful that this paper now recommends that as a general principle but most of the
following a review by the county surveyor we suggest further things which are automatic consultation with local members and indeed this process of public consultation be brought forward to the beginning of the whole procedure of traffic managing reviews now that sort of consultation will be more in the nature of a public meeting than a semi formal enquiry but we recommend to you that we use the same sort of terminology so that the public UNK that they are genuinely being consulted by the county council now if we find that there are very contentious proposals after an order has been published er a c h a county consultant of hearing may still be held if as members you feel that's something you want to do because the objective of this whole concept of county consultant of UNK is to have er flexible arrangements so that the county council can demonstrate its commitment with consultations at a local level to demonstrate that members in particular are hearing what local people er say and to set up procedures within the organization to give members particularly local members more involvement in the traffic management review process those are the recommendations chairman which involve in the paper
yes thank you
erm yes thank you chairman
as most of the main towns in suffolk have reviews every two years are you UNK having er those that sort of interview of erm public hearing
er what every two years sorry
they have traffic management erm reviews every two years
can't image them every two years
this is
that's general policy at the present time it's a fairly UNK objective that we didn't try at the review but the traffic management facilities and provisions are observed
and important UNK on the
oh i would be very happy that they would happen if we get them
mr
thank you
having er been invited to attend the first ever in county council hearing i'm delighted with it's as well received as it's had and i would just like to clarify point c which is after the relative sort of consultation with local members and the whole review of meeting er who will be present at the review meeting
well that's an existing stage at the moment which is an officer led stage with other representative bodies
local members as er appreciate with this paper will be kept informed and will also i should of said the chairman of the transport and road safety sub committee because the process of consultation won't work effectively unless local views are heard and they of course can be heard through the local member
thank you very much
at this stage perhaps i can emphasize jan this is such a flexible concept that er we are anxious not to lay down any rigid rules as to how it works because if some things don't work very well they can be altered and if some things do prove to work well like the event we had at felixstowe we can build on that success so quite consciously we're not laying down any rigid rules as to how things go and we will look to review how officers we erm advise you as members in the light of practical experience
thank you
any other comments
yes
just one comment chairman i see the
is on three two
i would make the observation that when er you come to
i agree with all the items on four two but i think also the local press except for
should carry an advert saying that in fact this will take place erm and what the procedure is i think and also to advertise if possible in local shops that sort of thing because that is the only way we're going to get
at some of these things preferably at felixstowe an example a local newspaper was used to advertise the actual hearing i think the i said the important thing is that people do appear do turn up do voice their opinion do make sure who their county councillor is a local member and other county councillors in all their process actually know what local people feel excess through their local positions any other comments
sir
yes
i think one of the most valuable points that emerged from the felixstowe experience as far as i was concerned anyway was the fact that with all those people there when we heard their views erm it was quite apparent that it wasn't the case of local people opposing what the county council traffic people propose to do many there were many different and varying interests there and we could we can then basically come to a conclusion which satisfied i hope most of them but we at that meeting among the local people some supporters with some of our road safety and some were very much against them others were neutral but it wasn't just a question of erm a united opposition of what we proposed to do er and this was very valuable
thank you can we in that case accept the er the recommendation
right we'll now do turn the page to t six four which is the UNK by graham by officer
chairman less than one year ago since the report prepared for this committee recommending that work should commence on the preparation of the new bypass scheme of the town of brandon and since that date considerable progress has been made
consulting that people gave basic traffic mentioning survey work which has been carried out and public consultation has been undertaken in the town focus upon an exhibition of possible UNK held in july this year at the brandon community centre
now the results of that years work public of all members today in four t six four and the report provides a summary of our findings the existing problems on this section two point one point one and the possible solutions on summarized in section two point one point two
consultation has revealed a most marked preference for route a which is the green route shown on the consultation leaflet attached to the report and if looks would divert the primary route the a ten sixty five around the north west premature the town of brandon the summary table of cost and benefits showed within the consultation leaflet identifies that route a gives the best value for money it has least impact on land use and it offers the shortage and therefore possibly the most attractive reduction to UNK traffic on the a ten sixty five access
unfortunately chairman there has been some UNK of opinion between the norfolk and the suffolk interests
the county council's consultants and myself both recommend route a on grounds of traffic benefit engineering assessment and economic practice
our own planning committee county council planning committee recommends route a on environmental and UNK grounds and route a is the popular choice the town speak and the brandon action group and indeed the suffolk member of parliament however the norfolk county council and the UNK parish council oppose for the day and the norfolk member of parliament supports their case worth noting that UNK district council the local planning authority in norfolk also UNK for a day now though it appears to be so this is not altogether a case of
playing between two county councils and their
their respect of community
since there is some evidence that the fears expressed by the UNK parish council about long distance lorries being diverted to the bury st UNK brandon UNK king's lynn
the b eleven o six a consequence of this county council's lorry ban on the a ten eighty eight and that does have some evidence to support that theory and paragraph two point five in my re report sorry two point three not two point five two point three in my report referred to that thing
so chairman it would appear that finding the correct solution for a brandon bypass is linked to the problems surrounding the department of transport proposals in suffolk to trunk the a one three four road between bury st UNK and UNK and the a ten eighty eight lorry UNK and in my view therefore the debate needs to be extended to a
before the UNK solution can be identified
a solution which hopefully will resolve quite a number of related problems
the importance of norfolk county council views are referred to in paragraph two point four point two and unless norfolk support for route a can be obtained then suffolk county council will eventually be UNK to proceed with what is clearly a preferred option when measured UNK
it is really in my mind almost a repeat of the situation we found ourselves in the UNK western bypass some year or two ago which UNK into essex onto which the essex county council raised objection er one cannot build a road in an adjoining county without the consent in law of the county highway authority on whose ground you UNK it's almost as simple as that and in this case with norfolk standing presumably indicating their intention to oppose the construction for a day we have something of a static bar situation unless we can reach agreement
since the strength of feeling by the norfolk members chairman only became really apparent in the last two dates and the wires of telephones were hot yesterday with a conversation between myself and others north of the border and since discussions we held yesterday with representatives of the department of transport in UNK indicates a solution to suit all interests to make it achievable
i seek leave this morning to hold my recommendation to adopt for a day as per bungay bypass tending member discussions which need to be held with representatives from both suffolk county council and norfolk county council
now these discussions could be held very quickly and in the very near future and really cause no effective delays in the provision the actual provision of the brandon bypass since we all know it's not scheduled construction anyway until the second part of this decade
i also recommend chairman that these member discussions should be extended to include representatives of the UNK and district council given their declared opposition to our preferred choice route a and the important procedures now associated with the UNK of local plans
chairman i'm conscious that this amended recommendation will cause some disappointment among the support of the brandon bypass but i generally feel that some form of agreement can be reached with norfolk county council and UNK district council and indeed the norfolk member of parliament if i'm given more time to review the situation in the light of other proposals on the a eleven the a one three four and in UNK
chairman i will endeavour to arrange discussions as a matter of extreme urgency and report back to january ninety three meeting of this committee hopefully with problems resolved
so chairman i offer in UNK of three point one the formal recommendation an alternative recommendation which is as follows it is recommended that further consultation take place with norfolk county council and UNK district council at
prior to the next meeting of the highways committee before any decision is taken with regard to a preferred route for the brandon bypass
gentlemen if you accept that amended recommendation it will be necessary this morning to identify those members of your committee who will take part in this joint committee
thank you chairman
thank you right yes
thank you sir er mr has mentioned the disagreement er the potential disagreement between norfolk and suffolk county councils what happens may i ask if that er disagreement cannot be resolved at the local UNK level is the minister called in
the situation basically is that i am confident i can come to accommodation with norfolk from my way of thinking as the neighbouring highway authority those the people we've got to er to make certain are on site i'm sure i'm confident enough to do that
there is no if you like no mileage to be gained in two important local authorities falling out over a particular issue
i'm sure that as long as we can show norfolk we can show norfolk with our concern interest just as much as suffolk is concerned that our
there are reasonable people in norfolk they've got a they've got a good committee and i'm sure that our working relationship will be
but in the very unlikely very unlikely er position whereby norfolk are absolutely UNK oppose our proposals then as mr said it's very difficult for us to build in neighbouring authority there is however one procedure left to us and that of course will be for us to meet in private act of parliament well that is er almost UNK but we do have a final resort to that with a in many ways the problems in brandon have to be resolved by doing a bypass and if in the end we have to do that i'm sure that
committee but i'm it's a long way for us to go on that particular path
i'm delighted to hear that sir and er i was also delighted to hear mr say that this start date is not likely to be delayed because of this prior agreement that is necessary and i was hopeful that er brandon bypass could retain the position that's retained itself on our agenda papers this morning i e
i mean on our on our plan we have before us we have no there erm indeed of er of er of
industrial area and that consists of er
steel stock holder there is in fact er a wood saw there's also a shed manufacturer and also a clear waste of UNK also uses that there are large houses erm in there and all that traffic has to UNK along through residential areas again onto er onto public routes er indeed also in fact UNK road is very UNK looking er settlement if i can use that expression so for UNK my proposals would in fact disguise that by UNK and by tree planting in fact i think that UNK would gain considerably and it's these sort of things which we will press upon your vote to draw their attention not just the
people of suffolk but in brandon important though those are there's
knock on effects benefits to the rest of the
and the rest of the district and i'm sure arguments will carry considerable weight
mr
chairman could i suggest to you that erm when we have our meeting with norfolk county councillors that erm the rail policy group supporting to this because although the traffic UNK policy do and indeed the norfolk rail policy group are not formal county council committee erm we know that norfolk rail policy group have identified the northern group as the most desirable to their point of view because of the possibility with freight and road UNK at er brandon and so i may i suggest that a representative from both norfolk and suffolk rail policy groups they're included in this meeting with the north councillors
that was that was to be wasn't it
can i ask a further question councillor please
yes of course
er mr mentioned UNK district and norfolk county and suffolk county in this consultation process could i ask if
district will be invited to send a delegate or delegates to this
well of course forest heath are already on site aren't they
i mean it's i mean er we still consider i mean in many ways it's UNK but particularly norfolk we want to particularly their members we want to get we want to get to i mean er you'll need obviously great support authority district council but er i will i will consider that but i don't really think it's necessary for that
thank you
there we are
would it be UNK would it be a good idea to have UNK par parish council there as UNK well or representatives from there
well it's those things that we would like to have decision making in these matters and let's face it norfolk county council or the highway authority and UNK are the people of the
if you widen it out we're talking about a consultation and i think in many ways we must respect the local member erm
represent the meeting will no doubt be present from UNK and no doubt will put the views erm but it's this UNK and norfolk you wanna get to grips with and it's only members you wanna see i will in fact er you know i'll make that point anything that's necessary at the meeting parish council will be present but i'll get onto er
thank you
any other comments
what about the actual erm we know how it is
on this in our january meeting february meeting i'm sorry february meeting are there any other comments members want to make now about proposals which were on the table about the actual route line which was the one
yes do come back on that
i was gonna be happy to move the recommendation sir and anyone who's aware of the traffic problem in london road brandon will support that and also sir the figures that in the questionnaire that was sent out support route a UNK because you'll notice that double the people er double the number who returned the questionnaire supported route a as opposed to any of the other alternatives so i think the recommendation that we were to accept this morning's various adequately worded and accepted
i hope er the chairman that the committee will not follow mr 's suggestion and will in fact support er erm mr 's alternative er suggestion er as been stand at the moment to accept the recommendation on the order paper alone with the
we need to resolve this one in consultation with norfolk and er therefore mr er erm proposal that further consultation should take place must be the right one to follow
yes we need
i think mr misunderstood chairman with respect that isn't what i was saying at all what i was saying was had mr not made his statement this was the one that hopefully we would all of accepted
apologies to mr
that's quite alright sir we all make mistakes
thank you yes i think in a course of er explanation that's been given this morning there was a reference to h g v eight diversion now i'm concerned that if in fact that means that er h g UNK are increasingly using the route through UNK there are two very severe right angle bends on that road and i should erm like to see the police take some action to persuade h g v to ban that route er i mean can we do a ban on the early section of it with in particular to like angle bends are
i think i'm not promised at present the lorry ban as it is resulting parking on
we'll certainly look at that yes
thank you and that er
chairman could i just have one final
of course
a mi a very minor point that is that while we're er carrying on these negotiations and i think it can be done without thought without er making the UNK from the start of this bypass there is one minor point in that and i think it could be dealt with and that is the people of brandon can see that the pedestrian crossing near the small roundabout in the centre of the town is far too close to that roundabout and they er believe that it causes considerable traffic hold ups and i see erm no reason why this pedestrian crossing shouldn't be moved
to accommodate else yeah
can we ask the surveyor than in fact to er ensure that pedestrian crossing is shifted to accommodate er the local wishes is that is that okay
i'd like to take that on board and review the situation that we give given a UNK still therefore a purpose and i hear what mr has to say and i look at that particular UNK crossing myself and respect the
flow of the roundabout but then where do we put it
perhaps it's not easy to find an alternative part so i'd like to take that from you chairman if i may and be assured that will be reviewed as far as the
the dismissed point about
the problems is thought er are i hope will be addressed by the we've got the solution to the problems on the a one three four trunk road and
county council and the department transport strategy right now is to see the a one three four north of bury st UNK be made a trunk road and the
situation i'd suspect will be addressed within that other part i did mention in my presentation that there are a number of inter related problems here i can trace about four or five all of which have a chain reaction one upon the other unfortunately brandon is up front so we've got to tackle it from the other direction
i hope the negotiation with norfolk will give us that opportunity and the negotiations with the department of transport as well we must not leave them out this they are crucial to the solution of the entirety of these UNK
chairman
what i think at this moment chairman is that route contains several UNK
okay
and the h g UNK on that route are very dangerous
point
let's go on
chairman if it's possible for the for the UNK crossing to be to be moved from one place can we ask mr if it's going to help the local neighbourhood in any way we ask mr if that is done yesterday rather than a review and then coming back to us in due course let's get on with it if it can be done
right
right okay we've had the discussion come the debate i said the er the use of norfolk who they knew what we were about were only
made to us yesterday and the
recommendation is slightly UNK down UNK with the highways can be using the
i think it will be helpful if er the group and members and could i suggest please the members be myself my chairman mr the leader of the er labour group and mr as being a local independent member and possibly mrs and possibly er mrs to join us
because we are issued with the ten eighty eight which you've had er ought to be brought into plan
happy to serve on that party sir
er mr chairman i trust the local member mr be my
yes certainly
i second that
are we all happy with that
are we all done
yeah
okay the recommendation then as proposed on as
chairman the amended recommendation i offer as follows it is recommended that further consultation take place with norfolk county council and brandon district council at
prior to the next meeting of the highway committee before any decision is taken with regard to
for the brandon bypass
and we can combine that with those list of members which we agree so agreed with our colleagues in norfolk is that agreed
move that be accepted sir
thank you very much
may i move on please to the next paper
may i suggest that
thank you sir
thank you
could i erm bring back to order and er ask for the approval for agenda eighteen
thank you chairman and far the experiment fact on the a
one thing is for sure we have succeeded in dramatically reducing the volume of noise using the a ten and
in its UNK purpose it has therefore undoubtedly be an outstanding success but as the report makes way clear the experiment has had adverse to that effect UNK on the a one three four and on minor roads from the east on the a ten eighty eight
from the outset the wide impact of the ban was and anticipate the experiment has given me opportunity for it to be tested on the ground so that future decision can be taken UNK
strong feelings have been generated by this experiment and report UNK in paragraph three four and three the main group in which they fall
the county council has been very active in trying to find a way forward which UNK the objective of UNK the a ten eighty eight of lorries but reduces the UNK run in through the small villages using what are no more than country lanes
at a series of meetings to invite UNK by a local member mrs the concept of issuing
to local
involved in local
was put forward as a possible way forward section four of the report describes this approach being more detailed
at the meeting on the fourth of november we referred to in paragraph four point eight the use of UNK was generally recognized as worthy of consideration
it is undoubtedly chairman something of a compromise but it should be moved as significant portion of the noise on the back roads although not all
it will re introduce some lorries onto the a ten eighty eight but only about thirty per day compared with the six hundred or so which have been removed as a result of a current experiment
if it is to work effectively it will require the good will of mr who in all discussion today has shown a most responsible attitude and i have no reason to believe that this will not continue
chairman may i just read the conclusions of a letter from miss she says in my it is my opinion that the local licensing scheme should be endorsed with a review after six months
the benefits the law and the villages all along the edge of eighty eight are so enormous that we must try and sustain and i'm very hopeful that would with the good will of the whole of us we can improve the quality of life for everyone
the recommendation before therefore is that a second phase of the county experiment be implemented for a period of three months to six months whichever is felt necessary to allow the effects of
to be modified thank you chairman
yes thank you mr er mrs do you want to come in now or do you want to
yes well just er briefly chairman i've seen the television cameras being set up on UNK bridge so i'm quite certain you don't want to UNK this meeting and er in case they go away
right i think that's a very good idea
er chairman thank you for inviting me to come erm here today er particularly as mrs who's the other member of erm affected by the lorry ban on the a ten eighty eight it's unfortunate unable to come erm and thank you for including me in the er consultation process that you're planning with norfolk county council er chairman obviously i wish to support this but just erm if i could make a couple of observations on your paper erm firstly particular relation to the discussion we just had about brandon erm i am aware mr chairman you've just described the er highways people in norfolk as very reasonable but i think that members will see particular if they look at problems like four point one that we do have to handle er working relationships with some care and i would want to express regret while i won't be less UNK than that but norfolk have not even seen fit to put up signs erm warning of the lorry ban erm in UNK erm which shows er not exactly the spirit of co operation i hope we're going to be able to achieve in the consultations about brandon and i thought
it is part of the problem we have
it is part of the problem we have and i will say no more as i suspect our report of today will probably be in the daily press
erm chairman i'm very sorry to if i may just mention this that in the representations and observations that er are summarized in three point three erm i personally have copies of letters written by parish councils all along the a ten eighty eight route erm obviously i'm referring to UNK
and UNK i believe all those parish councils have written to the county surveyor erm UNK the er h g v ban and saying how successful they think it is now the proposals in this paper don't have any particular effect on them but i would want to pass on to the officers here in case it hasn't erm quite registered but this ban has been very much welcomed on the northern section of the a ten eighty eight where although it's not a formal ban the affect on villages particular such as
which has very sharp bends and
has been considerable chairman my one concern which has in fact shared by mrs as mr referred in his letter is erm how long is this experiment should run for erm how long five point seven the first of three months although the wording isn't it is in fact half the recommendation i would want to er agree with mrs suggest that this be six months erm because three months particularly in the winter months can't really be considered a very thorough experimental period
er chairman thank you for listening to use of the
er actually who are all in front mostly from UNK which i represent they have made their views known to me some years ago er this might happen erm i'm very glad that you have responded now to their concerns as well as the concerns of the villages and this paper does mark significant erm success co operation between a lot of people involved and for that reason i welcome it i would ask if it becomes be prepared to make it six months instead of three months please
any contents what's the problem of three months six months any problems there
none whatsoever chairman
yeah slightly scored and that struck at the meeting which miss land where one district council accused
in terms of the problem
refusing
and i think that was the only
mr er yes
thank you chairman i think er sp mrs in saying that all the UNK are affected by the
and the eighty eight group in favour of happy and have to do the best certainly
and as you well know there has been a series of meetings in
to try and UNK the situation in
erm nevertheless i must report again on the plan eighty eight er on the a ten eighty eight principally because even in england people realize that the villages in
particularly in UNK were affected very badly so you do support the ban on the ten on the a ten eighty eight and we do support an extension of that date i'm not happy about the six month extension i would be much happier with the three month extension i think the people in
would prefer that too er partly because it would give everybody an opportunity to look at the particular problem er in a shorter period of time erm we are also UNK by the recent visit to england by the minister there mr who made certain promises i think it would be useful if mr who a candidate at the meeting would reiterate his promises publicly today thank you chairman
right do you want to comment if you wish
yes please mr chairman
chairman there were three areas of concern the longer term objective were of course the bypass that is some way into the future the more the media is that is concerned with traffic calming the more comprehensive traffic calming would be the subject of some in depth study who'd defined exactly what pieces of traffic are most suitable for that village but one element and that was to do with
in particular and some put gateway effect and possibly the UNK you see for example on the a twelve at brandon in er UNK rather is something that we feel we could do readily and in the near future so an element of that is calming in the very UNK future more comprehensive traffic calming a little further into the horizon and i'm afraid the bypass some time much further into the horizon i think chairman i hope that er miss that's an adequate summary of our discussion
thank you
thank you mr for your support i know it's very difficult er you know in your past as a lawyer in consequence i think that your er UNK towards this is a highly commend
anyway can we set the recommendation
yeah
just in just in passing on this committee i'm assured will be concerned of the apparent difficulties between er the highways er and the organization of suffolk and that in norfolk erm and we shall be i think er wishing to look at that er to see what's going UNK and something appears to me to be not quite right in the relationship and er erm i think it's important that er adjoining highway authorities do in fact get on
indeed
so now if i've got to knock the UNK heads together that's
chairman i must
can i move on please
accept the recommendation
agreed
agreed
thank you very much
now
chairman i
yes
north set ignore the map i think it is erm very important the map i saw this outline about ten years ago erm and neither has the fast
golf course been constructed erm where the road proposals are going through
i'm not sure on this map
pardon it's not it's not shown on this map no cos erm the golf course have been instructed erm since this er plan been put in front of us some ten years ago
can we accept recommendations
chairman
agreed
can i very briefly how is traffic going to enter into the village if option one is in fact stopped
sorry forgive me this is the whole point this is just for your information what has happened in the past we're now looking at looking for a new
because things have changed so much in the ten years we've got to look at new options
the reason why it's before you is because of the local plan
yeah
the highway problems has got
otherwise an additional process of handling enquiries is
all i want to obtain from you is that the information the that it will not be excluded around about the end as soon as they take place
nothing is ruled out
thank you
okay
can we move on please into the next general item which is the er sorry the badly
paper t six
yes thank you chairman a very power survey of the present
has been undertaken and the result UNK in the full report the summary of which is produced as a
the findings show that there is a concentrating vehicles in the centre of the town particularly st mary's street and
carrying some eight hundred vehicles in the
and both streets falling within the conservation area
the results of the survey are broadly consistent we found in similar sides specific problems of traffic congestion in the town centre but elsewhere a few traffic problems
some pressure on central area short stay parking particularly
street and the one expense scandal personal injury accident although overall levels are not UNK high
one of the purposes of this day was to examine the north
bypass the
and the report is early warning that based on present level of flow the volume of traffic using such a bypass would be UNK low
some two thirds of that
currently used in the a one four south of the town means stopping rather than through trips
while even this degree of relief chairman in the town centre would be welcome the problem comes in trying to justify a new bypass in terms of its cost effectiveness
nevertheless a traffic model will be created and used to predict future traffic demand the survey gain as described in this paper is comprehensive and should enable effective testing of the
and be confident in its ability to forecast future of how it flows only at that stage then will be the liability or otherwise in the north south bypass be fully known as will also the role to be played by traffic management measures
the specific recommendations are contained in paragraph four point one of the report
yes the paper actually
and in fact the result of co operation between suffolk and norfolk which i hope you know both be recognized i'm sure it did
in norwich er councillor yes
well thank you chairman i have to go back to last wednesday afternoon when i had a telephone call from a reporter from the eastern daily press asking me to make a statement on the press release by suffolk county council stating that the bungay bypass has been abandoned well chairman i have to say that i was somewhat erm put out because i did i UNK i think because they the highway department didn't have the courtesy to inform me first and you can well imagine how i felt er having received this news
i UNK from making any statement until i had the erm minutes which i received the er agenda which i received the next day which UNK the UNK but if the idea was to sort of give this UNK member from bungay a heart attack er it failed cos i'm still here and ticking now i would like to go through once again the point regarding bungay and i hope the committee will take it on board with
the traffic flow through bungay had increased by thirty per cent over the past ten years
these aren't my figures they're county council figures the point is this what is going to happen if positive action is to reduce the flow of traffic i have to emphasize with you the flow of traffic is not taken
i said at the last meeting in bungay in january that bungay will cease to function within five years if something wasn't done about it
i don't wanna
realized
bungay is a is an historic and a delightful town and one that UNK on environmental ground alone for a bypass i refer to paper t one erm which is er paper of the ninth of january nineteen ninety two and if you refer to little b seven five UNK for towns and villages where there is serious and environmental UNK by through traffic
and i think that bungay UNK on that grounds
when the outstanding plan of consent are completed and the industrial state in place anticipate the traffic will be UNK
t six states that thirty four per cent of the traffic to bungay is UNK in brandon has forty per cent
from my own observation the majority of thirty four per cent is heavy traffic we have the additional problem that the shops in saint mary's street with the majority of shops in saint mary's street that is the main street have no rear UNK
consequently heavy lorries make deliveries and other heavy lorries passing through cause congestion
the traffic through UNK street although a one way street causes great concern and inconvenience for the residents in two three two it erm you'll read that it says erm lightly generate well believe me it does cause problems
UNK street is the only route to the a one four
the report mentions clay as being a major employer there is also UNK poultry of
just outside bungay they have they employ around five hundred people
now the UNK at
employ twelve hundred people much of their traffic passes through bungay their products their employee and supplies are all over the place and their products are distributed country wide much of their traffic goes through bungay and i think they both have plans to extend their plants both er UNK and bernard UNK
taking into account the length for the length of the features and the cons the consultation that take place and the length of time they take i do not expect to see er bungay bypass construction for some time yet but i do expect the county council to progress on that in such a manner that bungay will not grind to a halt
er chairman this matter has caused great concern in bungay i can tell you i went to the bungay town meeting last night and they were absolutely horrified at the way this has been handled and i have to apologize on behalf of the of the county council
i would ask this committee to keep this in the programme and to monitor the situation as it goes along
thank you chairman
well thank you
i think if you look at the recommend on most on the inevitable
the members of the town hall but also know the work on the assessment on north south london bypass is continual
mm
that is still ongoing erm the pressure is slightly er the wrong type of er
the work will be still continued on that but also in terms of bungay itself we're looking at whether county management can look at this and sort of if you like identify it so we haven't abandoned bungay far from it we're still concerned with the we've got the base of the facts still go on er and we're gonna continue on monday
mr anything you want to mention
chairman i think i have to offer an apology to members and mr in particular and the town of bungay with a rather erm over which sentence expressing the press release i mean we are continually trying to issue news items press releases progress reports and anything we're doing and usually the press are very good and quoted for a basis sometimes they get it wrong and UNK it up with some bits of disaster on this occasion that is not the case the actual press report did determine the phraseology used in my in lease them so i have to accept the responsibility for the phrase to act of your recommended this morning so it down sake could abandon ideas which they can buy it of course those crazy ideas used in and out of the court is what matters
the report does make it clear that perhaps sake the weak case at the moment UNK bungay bypass but the matter is not concluded yet we are continuing to work on it and its justification hopefully as recommendation make there but we do seem to have made little affect of this particular press release i can only offer my apologies chairman
thank you chairman can i can i come back
i accept this
on this on this particular matter i would like to add erm on c e g traffic manager as a UNK as a temporarily lease because i mean let's face it unless we plan ahead we are going to be in a hell of a UNK in trouble
alright fine with those comments can we ask you to accept the recommendations
agreed
mrs do you want to come in
erm yes can i ask please is this er if it were a bypass this is it long term
which i mean is after something of ten years in which case erm i would have that there's a thorough investigation so that actual you know er progress back it around the town as well as possible er need money put into it but i think that that's what some of these places with no hope of a short term bypass need
i've also have an application
chairman if the committee UNK that the
as a temporary release measure or as temporary release measures from mr suggest that
can we ask what temporary means
right after the a t traffic management has temporary release
i don't see it
no i don't
no
no
recommendation as on your paper is that agreed
thank you very much indeed
paper t six seven UNK bypass
thank you chairman erm in this report an interim mistake on the
progress so far and the commissioner to investigate both your bypass and
show little justification for a bypass just the consultants have recommended that options were released there should of taken for public consultation and the improvement should of
and carried out with its c six o two road which is the main link between the UNK and
members are recommended that they approve these two course of actions thank you very much
sir yeah thank you chairman i hope members will accept this recommendation in paragraph two three and two four says it all no need for me to say anything on this matter these figures are
thank you sir
can we accept them
agreed
agreed
thank you very much indeed
er the
thank you chairman
this report implies on progress in the
the prime factor at present is to ensure that all land need for the schemes should protect against other developments and that flexibility is divided in
construction of the a twelve
and further development that's all i have to add mr chairman
yes thank you fine
can i mr chairman
of course
first start with very quickly
that's right of course
you see er have some er just a few comments i mean i'm not UNK with the outcome of that
i certainly mr chairman welcome this paper erm and i know today that i think possibly the main reason being erm i could be deemed also been through and through today responding to our local issue and that maybe due to may fever i don't know erm in really accepting UNK as i have done in the past your efforts erm the county UNK efforts for this part of suffolk i do again bring to your attention and i don't think is being critical in that the UNK by bypass is part of a far bigger UNK and that UNK i say not
but it UNK from here to ipswich and it UNK from here to the norfolk border
now yes this is very welcome indeed but i do see it mr chairman in the experience of the past and that really with the hard work that you both have put in as a piece of paper it is now in the computer as far as i can see and i think there is a term now within agriculture and i will give you an example of this and i think it now it may apply i think to our road system particular particularly in the north suffolk yeah i think the term is set aside and i hope that some time central government will acknowledge that within this eastern region certainly the UNK area and UNK area we have very great problems because these pieces of UNK do not come into the full picture they're put in place now and then and later and in apparent it is giving us a very great problem certainly within the last
the
area and so on
we cannot get our raw materials in we cannot get UNK projects out so please can we push with the dealing of the a twelve so that we can get in and out of the south
can we get our link roads in
can we get our northern UNK road finished
er can we get our eastern bypass finished
there are so many parts of this UNK that still are not in place and again mr chairman through you i know you have similar to this case although you put it strongly it has to be widely UNK we must be linked not only to the rest of the country but even more importantly now linked to the continent welcome very much indeed but not in place
yes i hear what you say er in fact recently we had a request from the local member of
reporter to erm again join with him in beating the UNK formally so that it moves on the a twelve and the other issues was over something which we can easily draw attention to civil servant and of
we are doing the very best we possibly can
thank you
chairman
yes
could i also remark to erm councillor made as regards to the er any progress to er to eliminate these er primary bends which one of the most dangerous sets of road
yes
in the area
very UNK a busy road and erm i know er UNK the main causes the most accidents if you probably right i mean speed is the main cause i use that road way at night con UNK with all traffic regulations been UNK by vehicles at speed
right er thank you
can we move on please to page six nine mr
er this report refers to just the new road terms within the appropriate switch of transportation strategy which as you know represent other proposals relate to certain facilities and off street parking bus priority and major park
and other aims to resolve problem of traffic suggestion
the bullet UNK in this well very briefly erm about for half a dozen of them first of all erm i'd like members to be aware of the increasing interest being taken by the department of transport in the ipswich transportation strategy and the ipswich traffic study before that the predictions we have from our consultants for the year two thousand and six and particularly their interest in their own trunk road system around ipswich and the capacity of the UNK bridge so that department of transport in UNK are suddenly come to life to see what's happening and have requested access to the information we have required from previous investment and consultancy work and the panel of members the joint panel of members ipswich suffolk recently gave approval to expose for being their findings of our work to the department of transport which i think is a very good move and only be of some valuable to us ultimately
the report also deals with the environmentally impact UNK work which has now been completed in respect of options for the ipswich multi bypass and the east bank
i can tell you chairman that a preferred route will be offered for approval by this committee in january in respect of the east bank
the work has come to well in hand on development and drawings to show that proposal
the public consultations on options for the ipswich northern bypass is being lined up at the moment at office level for mid nineteen ninety three there's still quite a bit of work associated with the preparation for that UNK that you see but a more measurable benefit i think chairman is er that the that before there is a recommendation that the threat of widening
road can now be lifted er along with the UNK with the planning guide with no less than one hundred UNK suffered er over recent months
and also capable of being abandoned lifted deferred set aside ignored is the option are using if report authorities own UNK system within the west bank in order to provide improve road access er from the west end road that option is also
to be to be erm abandoned thank you chairman
mr
yes briefly mr chairman i sent a simply acceleration in meeting so i won't keep you
here i'd like to say that i do very much welcome the UNK of the two UNK routes it gives me particular satisfaction because you recall earlier in the year there was some irresponsible press comments on the subject which greatly upset a lot of people
absolutely
who thought that their houses were going to be demolished er preferably on christmas eve or
that and so on erm i it would be nice in fact if the er ipswich evening tabloid which gave us UNK to this rule er would give just a little space to er this latest development erm but i would like to not being UNK i mean reading this document i do feel a slight er switch on your comments on er UNK vale er which you note there are no er nationally er or er common species which sounds as though you have designs on it erm i wonder if this would be the place to ask you know to make some sort of statement about UNK vale you know that we are basically looking for a route which does not touch on UNK vale
well in fact in fact if you will see
or some sort of reassurance for it
you can see in fact you know the position for every option adopted in january i think the er some of the things i've seen will in fact will minimize the impact upon UNK vale but i think that i think we'll have to wait until after christmas to get the er final recommendations from the er from the
mr
it's unlikely there will be any significant impact on UNK vale could we say that
i think that's
go on force yourself mr chairman
yes mr
erm yes as you know i'm a member of the essex traffic group and we did state at the time there will be no looking into or no pulling down of any type of property or building yeah but it erm the council went ahead and looked at UNK road
yes
and knocked down a hundred and fourteen properties
that's right
and to me it's a complete waste of money erm
well forgive me the reason for that is it was explained at the time if one's going to defend the decision of where you're going to put your roads then you've got in reality look at all them options ridiculous some they will be whether they dig UNK under the UNK or knocking down UNK road i mean it's all got to be looked at
yeah i know but that's no option is it
because we've said we've stated that there be no pulling down of any type of building
sure we've got to defend our position at a public enquiry
erm also i've been i did phone the office up because i wanted to be report on the environment impact
yes
er assessment
yes
of erm UNK vale erm how much did it consult how much did the consultants charge the county for this
how much is the cost of the er impacts on
er i'm afraid chairman we don't have the final account here
erm
any ideas though
what sort of figures we talking about
well i'm sure that we could of got it free through erm suffolk wild life trust and it
well will it
every recorded species from UNK animal bird life flower is in the ipswich museum and also helped by the suffolk wild life trust i've got information by it right here
why is
fair enough i mean we're gonna have the full debate okay the full debate in our january meeting
i'm having a dig now
cos i won't be here in january thank you very much erm
also my
town councillors have been asking the county officers for information on the so called secret road what's the
say it say it again
on the so called secret road where where's the so called secret road go it's been in the evening star we have asked the borough council list and the borough er the council has asked erm for information of this road and they haven't even been replied to
chairman i must respond to that the work secret road is not UNK to this organization i think it's one UNK onto by the press to develop some headline er nobody's ever used that phrase about anything being secret in this organization whatsoever the simple fact is that these drawings for your approval are not yet finished that's the extent of UNK my staff are still working on them they'll come
secret road is a phrase UNK up by somebody seeking the headlines isn't it
borough council that
er and as the
er and chairman i must say that as to request from county council at UNK and county council at UNK from the ipswich borough council for their copies of the plans which you have not yet received i have to decline the protocol it takes that this committee is the first to see the county UNK proposals and i can't give any other elected member within suffolk prior treatment over that to be quite honest
erm can i ask this committee then erm i'm i've UNK
yes
erm the west bank option for widen UNK road to be abandoned that i quite agree with and design on and then follow that i'd like erm do environmental report for members to be or for members to look at the environmental report before it comes here
when do
have assessment the UNK mr
chairman i have a copy of the environmental impact assessment report in respect of east bank options west end road and ipswich northern bypass they've been on my desk from
for no more than one week we are still studying the recommendations the recommendations have to be embodied within the ultimate report for this community in
i just can't release that report in environmental
without perhaps UNK in some way of actually saying to you in january
well can we can we put this back until the february meeting
yes the extent of UNK and highways committee
well what's the good of us or hear both the UNK report when they bloody send the report
well no the money has the assessment will be paid for what the surveyor is actually saying is the actual recommendations and comments and that in the environmental
will be incorporated in his particular report he is a county surveyor he will make recommendations based on that report that report will be available to you
will that be a verbal report at the meeting or
no
will it with the
all the
assessments are available and mrs will confirm as the same as the cycling issue for example the value and assessments will be made available these are vast documents of many pages if you look at the actual the final page you'll see there in fact that the
on paper will be available this will
for all members
UNK eventually
a background paper to the january report and all members will have access to it
would erm would the chairman send me a report of this before the meeting
yes
thanks
yes i will
that'll be great
yes i will
thank you very much
chairman without erm
right i think you have spoken mrs but go on
no i haven't spoken
but very quickly please come on
i was just going to say that the county surveyor said that everything comes to this committee before anything else happens but of course it goes to the press before it comes to this committee and that shows with the
no it's not true that's not true
it's reported in the press very often before it comes to the committee
what actually happen in fact the papers are released to the public and so they
and it's reported in the press
and then the press pick it up
yeah
and then in fact the press have a apparently
to seeing these papers how many days beforehand mr
the same as we do
the same as us probably and we
but before it comes to this meeting
no
yes
it's the public comment these papers are in a public UNK
yes
obviously because of the information lapse now the decisions are not known to the
committee of actually emphasize what mr is actually saying is the ideas and the suggestions of this particular route will be incorporated in this report and should go before this committee and he cannot give a UNK of those ideas to anybody else
i accept that
i think this should be adjourned to half past two
but can i can i just say can we have an up to date figure on the environmental impact analyse
the cost
yes
we can't give that to you
can't you give us a rough idea
estimate
i'm sorry i've actually asked that question and while we're discussing it unfortunately we cannot do so as soon as i actually get a figure and i'm quite prepared to release it to you
would you
right
so are we saying mr chairman that we er launch ourselves into an UNK like an assessment without actually having an idea of the cost
do we just pay the bill at the end of the day
obviously have some indication of what someone's gonna charge
that's all we're asking for
but the final good is not
but that's all we're asking for
and move to accept the recommendations
mm
chairman i honestly do not have an indication of the final amount of costs this often happens with consultancy work it's like answering the question how long is a piece of string you don't know until you've reached the end of it
i have delegated authority to
other chief officers to report to the consultant i have
this is the manner in which the consultants were engaged we chose quality expertise er above all else in doing this work which is clearly going to be challenged from every day here on so the issue of having an agreed UNK figure will cost early on pay on the
compared to the importance of getting the right consultant to do the work alright
what i what i always lose track on i mean why is that the cost and the
by actual figures
yeah will that satisfy them
no what UNK me mr chairman is that here we are we're being cost conscious on every ground and we're saying we're making a statement that we enter into an exercise that we have no idea we're not asking for the actual cost we are asking we are asking you must of had an idea what it would cost or i feel mr chairman that can i put it UNK lack of planning and certainly financial planning possibly
there there's no lack of planning the appointment come on
been re delegated the suffolk
and he has delegated powers in fact to appoint consultants which is what he's actually done
i said that
now in terms of actual cost in particular i'm quite prepared to release those figures to you once mr has checked them
gone back to his office which is in ipswich i'm quite happy to release that information to you but at this point in time chief
i cannot say yours
can promise you is that commissions awarded on basis of competition we were looking for quality we invited bids we
a brief specification and receive responses from consultants what we don't have unfortunately practically everything else with us this morning but that one thing the estimated final cost of this work
in that case then can i now move you on to ask
you haven't UNK answered my question mr chairman i asked you why did the council vote to this museum on the norfolk UNK by trust which to be given you by the suffolk authority wild life trust
nothing to do with us
to give this information
what's the matter of importance here
i were
where the consultants went
i will deal i will deal with the action point that
if in fact we are challenged upon the UNK way of
we have got to be have confidence in our in our consultants that's the important thing
chairman the point being made by mr is covered in the manner in which our consultants who are they contact the organization of such a suffolk wild life trust i know the representations are embodied within the main report written by so they haven't been UNK
and that is another recommendation before this committee
er chairman i want to make a point relative very quick point relative to the northern bypass so mr said that officers are proceeding with the preparation of possible routes will you undertake that er members be er advised of er these discussions before it reaches committee stage
yes yeah and i move recommendation on
thank you
thank you very much indeed
in travel paper six seven o
agreed
agreed
agreed
and paper e seven five
agreed
agreed
agreed
just one just one
yes mr
chairman six seven one my report does indicate the officer who's made the involvement and he had to work
in the past the work erm the amount of work that's created backlog mainly because of staff shortage on research side
though the
commission is now involved with a grant of forty thousand pounds the situation has improved considerably and to bring the relevant matter up to date er recently the dispute has been looking the dispute of
and last week we launched the parish part
scheme at erm
wash and UNK erm this scheme erm
scheme or the
will be available from one first of april and up to sixty parishes will be invited to sign
agreements in the first year
the
scheme the joint
suffolk associations
representatives from these organizations
from twenty parishes were heavily involved in the
scheme will be invited to attend the meeting at newmarket on the twenty first of november er
any comment
well thank you mr also the work of the sub committee and thanks er for answering the questions right can we move on
yes
mr do you wanna speak sir
thank you very much mr chairman erm yeah i've put my hand up three or four times but er bridges mr chairman i would like to emphasis on the bridges it doesn't the width of the bridges yet bridges will be replaced
but er i think we must concentrate on the UNK people as well to get these places on
i know that the
one of the things that we saw open last week was a UNK gauge which was designed so that even disabled could produce them
can we move on
erm papers e six seven two
yes mr chairman
yes
i should thought mr chairman that number nine one b that erm they could of found a
within the department without having to really take on extra ones
mr chairman i would like to also the fact that
i entirely agree mr chairman
mr chairman could we adjourn and come back after because i think we're going to erm the way this committee is going
well if you knew the traffic situation first off you wouldn't suggest that
you wouldn't suggest that
maybe we could press on shall we
yes
i think in fact with the er UNK of the committee we need another ten minutes i think
er i think we would in fact please erm
t six seven two
chairman i've nothing to add to this particular report agreed
agreed
chairman can i just say in connection with this sir
yes
and i'll be very brief and that is with all this erm extra work coming in
in the day of high technology isn't it possible to devise some scheme where they can go round and spray camp which leaves an invisible but detective in a way of UNK or something er marking on the pavements in new master this week we've seen a UNK of white yellow green and blue erm spray paint on the pavements all by different contractors or
is it not possible to do something in this state of day in high technology
chairman we've
this town
sorry mr chairman we have regular meetings with the suffolk utilities and er this point can be made to them although each of the utilities has it's own colour so that then perhaps those intended which are holes that have to be repaired but certainly i can i can erm understand mr 's concern and i will put it to the next meeting of the suffolk highway meeting this week
mr chairman i'm
yes
er going back to er nine one b erm with the increased erm use of consultants for the workload erm of the department i am convinced that mr can find erm er staff within the department to carry this out and i think this is just erm a little bit of empire building
well you
ooh
ooh
with notts county once again
yes tonight notts play their second home match in group a of the anglo italian cup pisa provide the opposition with county looking to repeat their UNK victory over in their first game
does well with the challenge notts have picked up their game for on the left hand side
in now for turns shoots beats the defender shoots scores
in the last minute gary makes it four
four two the final score that night
tonight the weather might UNK supporters from attending but for those that do manager mick promises a treat
well the UNK the important thing
i ca i can never hide that fact but certainly if they come tonight they'll see some attractive football
erm i for one would certainly go anywhere to see the english beat the italians
that was just a little personal thing w with me
erm and i think it'll happen again tonight as happened a fortnight ago
mm
how much are the players looking forward to UNK their talent against er the UNK
well they were UNK this morning i think mainly because of saturday when it r we were UNK the whole club was lifted through saturday afternoon because something was shown that erm hasn't been shown for quite a while here
erm hopefully that'll be carried on tonight erm and i think it has that little bit of UNK with players playing against foreign opposition
erm the UNK always likes to stick one on them and i'm certain that'll be the case tonight
notts v pisa our main match tonight kick off is at seven forty five across to colin shortly we also have two coca cola cup UNK with UNK blackburn rovers facing potential embarrassment at third division shrewsbury
and we've got several competitions tonight
the first one we may as well get going now
it's a boxing video the prize tell me who are the three current world UNK champions please
the number to call
and living thing ooh that's about erm seventeen years old that record by the way november nineteen seventy six it was er in the charts according to the piece of paper in front of me
welcome along to the show then going italian tonight er don't know if we've got any italian music planned for you erm but we'll wait and see shall we
just a reminder of that competition question we have er several videos to be won this evening the first one is er the history of sport primitive UNK is its UNK and basically it's all about UNK people and that sort of thing
so there's plenty of boxing on there including the great UNK george and also UNK
so if you're a boxing fan this is the sort of video that you would enjoy now it's a boxing question name the three world UNK champions that currently hold titles
i know that sounds a bit ridiculous but you know what i mean there are several different er versions of the world UNK crown who are the three world UNK champions at the moment the number to call
let's go down to lane colin in position already UNK his italian names
colin how's it looking
welcome er martin
it's looking extremely wet of course i heard mike on the news say there'll be some heavy UNK of rain we've just had one and er everybody coming into the ground is UNK
but the paying customers are just about UNK at the moment by a very big UNK of travelling italian journalists just to my left and all pretty UNK by our normal quiet english standards
and er video camera and lighting among them and er they look as if they've been in place for hours
and er the er one thing that we've understood between each other is that they all UNK pointing the english
weather and i knew precisely what they meant
well this time next week of course we'll be in italy getting ready for notts against UNK and i remember last year when i went over with radio derby to cover derby county's game against
yes you're a UNK on these things martin
well you know i l don't like to UNK about it but er you know italy one week and
a little match a little match
st andrews the next
erm yeah when we went there
UNK tomorrow
UNK tomorrow
erm where was i
yes
there we when we went to italy last year it was er what i would describe as being fairly warm
mm
cos is southern italy and it was nice and sunny during the daytime so much so that we were walking about in just t shirts er and all the italians that came to us said ye well language what on earth are you doing without your er UNK
mm
and at least two UNK on
so er
yes
how would you think the weather i mean we're being a bit UNK but how will the weather affect the UNK team
well i don't think they'll like this one little bit will they i mean the players are out there practising at the moment they look very smart as well in an all blue UNK erm and erm obviously a club colour and they look very smart indeed er but er the journalists don't like it and i don't think the players will like it very much either
there've been some er conversations between the players out on the pitch and an italian journalist who clearly doesn't need a microphone in order to be heard
mhm
i wonder how important it is for those players because the competition over here has its UNK what about over there i can't imagine the italians being that bothered about doing well in this competition certainly the gates over there don't suggest that it's that important
er well no they don't do they
on the other hand of course it's the old story it's like some of the other competitions which we UNK rather in the early stages when you think of the freight rover and er one or two others as well
but the further they go the more interesting they get and of course er the visitors tonight have already had a good win
they beat middlesbrough three two er three one rather three one on their own ground in the first round er of the first leg that is to say of the er four matches in this particular round of the competition
er so erm they'll know that er the way the results went erm last time around means that it's the sides that do well away from home which may well go through
and er that puts some obligation on notts next week and then er in december to do well when they're in italy erm also an obligation to do well now but bu get back to the point i'm trying make
pisa here tonight know that a win here in nottingham tonight will put them in a very strong position indeed in this group er to go on and go through
er so it is important to them
that's right just looking at the er the tables that i've managed to get UNK to me from the football league today
pisa are indeed er top of the italian section of group a bolton UNK
yes
top of the english section
that's because bolton won five nil if i remember
that's right bolton won five nil but what we did get clarified from the football league today was if two english teams finish their four games on the same number of points is it goal difference or is it the number of goals scored that is the crucial factor
and rather surprisingly bearing in mind what happens in the UNK first division that there it is goals scored that dis UNK between teams in this league it will be goal difference that will determine the final positions followed then by the highest number of goals and then by the highest number of goals scored away from home
so at the moment notts county although they scored four goals and bolton scored five so in the current english system they'd just be one goal behind bolton their goal difference is only plus two UNK is plus five so that is a significant factor
er bolton today at home to UNK we'll keep our listeners in touch with that one as well
the only other game today in group a is er in italy against UNK
i doubt very much whether we'll have a score on that because it tends to be that we don't find out what happens in italy until er the following morning
let's have a word colin shall we about er UNK display er get your thoughts together on that and w we'll enjoy the goals from that er great victory against palace at lane when er notts fought their way back from being two down against the team that were second in the table great fight back
this could be danger
the shot comes in a brilliant strike palace take the lead it is bends it away goes and takes the UNK of the palace fans and not surprising on the quarter of an hour mark because palace have done the pressing and gets the goal UNK it away from a UNK to his left of and palace stamp their UNK a their authority on the early stages
good work plays the ball for
deep cross coming in brilliant header at the back post palace get a second goal and the UNK again is UNK at the back post brilliant UNK down the left superb finishing the hero palace fans on their feet notts fans sit in silence they trail two nil with twenty minutes gone a push on the referee looked across to the UNK on this UNK notts attacking the lane end and the UNK said penalty twenty one minutes gone here in this game just a minute after scored
it's going to be 's penalty comes up strikes it and scores
we've had three goals with just over twenty minutes gone has scored for the visitors on the fourteen with a brilliant shot a brilliant header on twenty and a minute later the penalty has brought notts back looking out of the game was the player pushed the referee consulted the UNK had no hesitation and ends the goal UNK for himself will leave on the bench
wins that in midfield UNK away edge of the area shoots
saved by martin shoots and scores
gets the UNK for notts
five minutes into the second half the UNK was from the boy was looking for his first goal and it's picking up the pieces for his second of the afternoon
and notts who were two down in twenty have UNK back to two UNK
turns there gets the header notts go in front it was brilliantly made by and had the easiest of jobs and what a UNK it is because notts UNK by two in twenty minutes and now they lead three two against the side second in the first division table who've been run UNK in the second half by a UNK notts UNK brilliant header
that was the action on saturday at lane
colin what a great fight back
yes it was at two down and the every time palace went forward in the early stages you thought to yourself here comes another goal because they looked like scoring they were so dangerous of course he's a real threat and he got the better of for that first goal er he was er danger all the time and er it was a little bit from er county's performance in reverse to that of the previous week at forest where erm palace were so good in the first half and er you wouldn't have been surprised if they'd gone in two nil or even three nil ahead the penalty brought notts back into the game
and then in the second half it was a completely different story
to my surprise palace UNK pretty completely er but that's not to take anything away from probably county's er best forty five minutes of the season though the four one against derby runs that pretty close
mm
now got two goals on saturday he doesn't play tonight he's got another UNK injury which is er quite a worry
how do think er notts are gonna cope without him because it seems as though when he is on form certainly when he's at home he finds scoring goals quite easy to come by
did you hear that little round of applause over the top of me
that's because tony has just emerged from the UNK tunnel
he of course was the man of the match on th saturday he sat here for the interview UNK the bottle of UNK that the club UNK had awarded to him for his performance
how will notts cope without you were asking
well we understand that they're going to paul up the front and of course is still looking for his first goal of the season
he's desperate to score one and it was rather curious on saturday that it was his shot UNK by a player with an england UNK should better than the palace goalkeeper did on that occasion
er UNK by pushed away pushed in by two er and that left er as the architect but not the UNK
same thing happened of course with he's desperate for a goal as well he makes the winner for but hasn't got his name on the score sheet
those are the two players who definitely from a confidence point of view need to score
and just a word about er the UNK because er obviously allowed to er name five going into the game and we hear that david and rob two of the long term injuries at er lane will be on the bench
yes and have both played in er in reserve football of course
i think that er probably from what i hear is the UNK of the two er for a UNK test i think still somewhere short of full match fitness certainly but er i know that er mick can UNK wait to get a hundred per cent and have him bidding for contention
if he does it'll be interesting to see whether or not he might be the player to come in and take gary 's place and see whether he can strike up a partnership with
the partnership is not really working although of course erm what happened on saturday was that after an awful UNK during the week verbally from mick their manager and indeed having both been brought off very UNK at UNK last tuesday evening both UNK in the closing stages when notts were losing and both strikers we er were brought off you couldn't get much more controversial tha that by a manager could you
erm mick said afterwards perhaps i ought to er try a verbal UNK of them before every game if that's the sort of response i get two from one from the two UNK on the score sheet
okay colin thanks for the time being
colin at lane for us tonight notts county against pisa and the UNK manager mick is joining us shortly
twenty two minutes after seven o'clock here's the UNK and staying alive
saturday night fever of course the UNK and staying alive twenty six minutes after seven o'clock
a b c radio nottingham sports special hearing from mick the notts county manager shortly and also getting the news on notts against pisa with colin
before that though let's just er take in one of tonight's coca cola cup UNK as shrewsbury have another chance to perform a giant killing act in that competition
they beat southampton from the UNK in the second round and have now forced a UNK in their third round tie against blackburn rovers
the UNK takes place tonight blackburn manager UNK of course has spent over twenty million pounds building up his side in comparison shrewsbury has spent three hundred and fifty thousand pounds
shrewsbury chairman reg though isn't UNK
they're on a hiding to nothing bless them and er th i mean UNK is no different to any other manager in the UNK league er they're all spending a lot of money in the hopes that they can buy their way to success
erm and i guess they will to a degree
i think the thing that worries me more than anything else about them that a lot of 'em have aspirations erm greater than their finances
if you actually look at what we've paid for some of the players say over the last two or three years i guess you're looking at about three hundred and fifty thousand pounds
but let me UNK to add that doesn't mean to say that that's what the team is worth at this moment in time because we have players there that are worth well in excess of that figure
it's all on the night isn't it you know it's all about the boys and who wants to win the match most tonight
ray the shrewsbury town chairman
shrewsbury at home to blackburn rovers of the UNK
shrewsbury by the way are a third division team they're about eighth or ninth in the table so er a great chance for them tonight to cause a major upset
that game kicking off at seven thirty so about two and half minutes before that game gets under way and er we'll be bringing you regular reports on that one plus tonight's other coca cola cup third round UNK peterborough against blackpool that one kicking off at seven forty five and that's the time of kick off in our local match at lane notts county against pisa in group a of the anglo italian cup
in a moment we'll be hearing from the notts county manager mick
before mick though let's just remind you of what happened in UNK first match in group a when they took on at lane
man of the match on saturday forward to oh and the ball in the area and UNK into the back of the net and claims it
it was all set up by got the touch and gets the final touch with twenty four minutes gone and notts deserve it they've been the better side in the early stages but that will settle their nerves and give the italians a little more to think about
oh it was a nice ball that by shoots and scores notts get a second just moments after they might have UNK one at the other end the referee UNK by the penalty claims but the crowd are there with a really fine piece of finishing by gary nine minutes to half time and adds to the one that got in twenty four and it's two nil to notts county against
to wide on the left shoots and scores oh it was lovely UNK between the two of them twelve minutes into the second half fine finish by
well it's a repeat of saturday isn't it set it up for then sets it up for now and it's three nil against
brilliant play by gets i clear down the right hand side and a fine header in
it comes in from the number nine gets the goal but it was brilliantly created for him there by and it's a quick response by right on the fifty minute mark we've had an hour of the match and it's now three one
brilliant play by and a really superb header by to make it three one
and again coming forward in numbers and they look at on the edge of the area and he is duly UNK by and it's a free kick in a dangerous position
at three one it may look comfortable it may sound comfortable believe me in d this last quarter of an hour even twenty minutes it hasn't been
the whole character of the game has been changed by a goal which er suddenly has brought to life in a way which we didn't see at all for the first half
free kick driven in and straight in
and it's three two
fine strike comes in from one of the UNK makes it three two direct from the free kick and suddenly from being three nil up into the last ten minutes it is three two
does well with the challenge notts have picked up their game wide for on the left hand side in now for turns shoots beats a defender shoots scores
in the last minute gary makes it four he was involved in the start of the move some good play by fed and lays on another and scores another
it's a second for gary it's a fourth for notts and er the little bit of tension that notts had created for themselves as they went off the boil and came really into the game with their two goals from first of all and then from the free kick but 's goal in the last minute here making it four two and really capping a most entertaining night for notts
they'd lost their way a little they've come back a little and they're going to win this anglo italian match
well mick it's now stage two of the er anglo italian cup it's pisa tonight er do you know anything about them as a team
er they're about halfway in their own league erm i think they beat by the odd goal the team that we beat four two here
i think they have more UNK than the other team in that they were in the first division four years ago erm so i think we can expect a harder game than we had last time
mm
i understand you've been UNK quite a lot with the italians over the last twenty four hours or so
well quite a lot we went out with them for a meal last night erm we had an UNK who was the only one that could speak english but it was it was well worth the evening it did a lot for relationships and i think that there should be more of this in football that off the field people should get to know each other a lot better and we felt at the end of the evening that it had been well worthwhile
do you see notts county this season in this competition being almost er UNK for english football
yes i think we do i think we do
erm i'd like to know more about italy i spoke a lot with their coach last night we exchanged addresses and telephone numbers afterwards and he assured me that th that we might do something even pre season next year
so certainly i w i would hope something would come from our evening last night
mm
and what about er notts county's name in italy because obviously it's th it's the first football club in the world and er if UNK is correct then UNK took their kit from notts county strip being black and white UNK so had they heard of notts county before
oh yes certainly
erm the young ones will remember nottingham forest but the ones with any depth i think are well aware that we are the oldest club in the world and that they were very keen to have a look at the ground
erm having seen the stand that's still up they realize that was built in eighteen sixty two but were very impressed with the other three
mm
on to tonight's game obviously you got one or two injuries going into it er unfortunate th gary obviously i has got a recurrence of that UNK strain because he got er two of your three goals at the weekend
yes he seems to be getting caught gary does whether it's the pace of our game or the fact that he isn't fit enough yet who knows
but er we shall be without him for the next fortnight erm so UNK have to come in and score a few goals for us but often you know you discover things that erm you never knew were there when you have to fill in gaps that have suddenly arisen
mm
now er before the game at the weekend you made a point of saying i want gary and gary to show to me that they can do the business
one got one goal the other got two so have they gone some way towards proving that to you
yes i w i would think so i mean it won't occur in five minutes of course erm and i would still say that i would like to see them in the six yard box more often
erm one was a penalty on saturday g gary 's and of course you can't er really lay a lot of credit for getting in the six yard box on UNK but he took his other goal well shot and he pick he picked the bits up off the keeper and gary scored a good headed goal from a brilliant cross by tony
so erm i still want to see more of what i was after
mm
what about tonight then er UNK out erm who's gonna come in to play up front instead of him
well paul UNK take his place erm paul f always full of energy and running and er th the only area that paul may slip up in is the goal scoring area where he won't be as lethal as gary
but certainly he'll be pushing and pushing at the front there and making runs to get in the back all night i'm certain of that
so we w we just might find a UNK tonight
mm
so er how does paul UNK the prospect of playing up front cos it's a role that er he hasn't played in while he's been at county isn't it
mm
paul will love any position where there's action
er he's a real action man er and a great professional and he UNK us all on monday morning when we've had a bad weekend er with his running and his enthusiasm
and i'm sure certain he'll be the same tonight
mm
what about at the back mick because richard missed er the game at the weekend with a UNK strain and now i understand that paul er might be doubtful for tonight
yes we've erm we've brought in to play left back and pushed into midfield playing with three mid UNK erm and we shall keep the same centre half UNK of and
an unlikely UNK but both did quite well the second half and 's experience and talking w we thought made the back four definitely stronger than in the last few weeks
mm
it's a pretty UNK day again today mick it's er it's raining it's UNK it's cold it's the middle of november it's gonna cost er the supporters a bit to come tonight er only two and half thousand came to the first game how anxious are you that county's supporters come out in their numbers this evening
well the UNK the important thing i c i can never hide that fact but certainly if they come tonight they'll see some attractive football
erm i for one would certainly go anywhere to see the english beat the italians
th was it's a little personal thing w with me erm and i think it'll happen again tonight as happened a fortnight ago
mm
how much are the players looking forward to UNK their talent against er the UNK
well they were UNK this morning i think mainly because of saturday when it r we were UNK the whole club was lifted through saturday afternoon because something was shown that erm hasn't been shown for quite a while here
erm hopefully that'll be carried on tonight erm and i think it has that little bit of UNK with players playing against foreign opposition
erm the UNK always likes to stick one on them and i'm certain that'll be the case tonight
mm
and obviously longer term if you can get er a victory tonight then obviously it sets you up with a reasonably good chance of going through from this group because two home wins a couple of away games to go and i it would set you up nicely
yes i think a team that can go away and UNK a win will be the team that gets through in the end
erm obviously most teams will win their home matches particularly with the travelling that's going off so if we can UNK a win when we go away and get a win tonight then we must be in with a good chance
mick it's a busy afternoon for you i'll let you get on with the phone call thanks a lot
cheers martin
you're listening to radio nottingham sport with martin
keep listening
and no i didn't er stay around to find out who was calling him suffice to say that it was er somebody from the italian UNK from down the road
er twenty two minutes away from eight let's quickly down to lane get confirmation of notts county's sixteen players on duty tonight with colin
that's what it is martin confirmation really of what er mick said to you in that interview steve tommy two three but playing at central defence dean UNK be the UNK playing in midfield michael at the heart of the defence phil in midfield paul UNK seven but will play up front er mark at eight in midfield UNK nine well that's a bit of nonsense isn't i in terms of UNK cos he's gonna play at left back not at centre forward gary is ten tony eleven then on the bench really good to see david and rod bob 's there as well along with er paul and that's er possibly a first chance for the UNK there and michael who has been UNK already but er a little bit of experience in and er the youngsters and as i say again it's really good to see and in the number and er i'm still practising and i shall give you the pisa team when you return to the er rather UNK lane with the UNK all UNK towards the back of the stands to get er extra protection from the er rain that's being swept a on to the stands and er has UNK the markings on the pitch
peter the UNK is out there bucket of whitewash UNK the pitch
colin with his UNK at lane
back with colin in a second for his final thoughts on notts against pisa in the anglo italian cup
in the coca cola blackburn one up at shrewsbury already
from UNK not one of er their better known records
there we go UNK island of lost UNK taking us round to eighteen minutes before eight o'clock on a tuesday night a radio nottingham sports special notts on the UNK trail tonight
course this time next week they will be in italy as we all go off to UNK in the er north of the country
UNK tonight playing bolton at UNK park and they lead by one goal to nil
with the goal after three minutes
and that's my italian name for the time being let's now hear let's now see how colin will do with er the pisa players down at lane colin it's all yours
i'll talk to you first about the notts county pl the ever improving young UNK at number two as the teams come out
led by the italian officials and er followed by er pisa and notts county and both getting a very nice round of applause indeed and what a very fine jersey is being worn by the er pisa goalkeeper
my words he could qualify for a part in joseph and the amazing UNK it's really something
steve in goal er tommy at two and phil at three dean the UNK is at four michael five phil six
paul seven mark eight is at nine gary ten tony eleven and on the bench david and rob back from their long term injuries a michael paul and the goalkeeper bob
the two teams lining up in the centre circle
for those who like to know these things the italians are in blue with their black UNK on the jersey and er black UNK and very smart looking team they are
and they both er wave to the crowds both sets of players and taken a round of applause as the two UNK are out there and there are plenty of cameras including video cameras er almost UNK my view and er i hope that gentleman is er going to take up a rather better position from my point of view because we want to see the er performances of the two teams
beginning with goal in goal for er pisa we've is at er right back and at left back UNK four five and six seven eight nine ten and is at eleven
that is the UNK starting UNK
there are some changes er from the er last pisa outing and er is not the regular goalkeeper but er clearly that er that jersey which is UNK at the back it has a number one on the back and it's UNK as he turns round
the game about to be got under way here it's the second time of course that we've had the taste of european football in just er inside a few weeks here at lane a very poor night for weather you who've not UNK out well i think we understand that er because er as we say it's not a night when you would turn the dog out
but er not that notwithstanding there are er a couple or three thousand UNK here at lane we'll get the official figure much later in the evening
notts in this first half are going to be as they like to be attacking the UNK end a UNK end which is utterly UNK because pisa haven't brought any fans with them but they've brought a very large following of journalists and as i said in the initial two way with martin there has been a language barrier between them and me but when they pointed to the weather and all UNK together i knew precisely what they meant
i don't think they've quite come prepared for it is the answer have pisa come prepared for notts county
well we shall find out in the course of the next hour and a half
the referee gets the game under way pisa kick off they're gonna be attacking the lane end
colin our man at lane as always comprehensive coverage of that game throughout the evening including some second half commentary as well we'll be sharing that second half commentary certainly as things stand at the moment with the game at er in the coca cola cup third round UNK where there could be a shock third division shrewsbury against UNK blackburn although at the moment the UNK team are doing pretty well blackburn already a goal to the good and the goal UNK now confirmed as mike after six minutes
the other UNK tonight is a little bit closer to home at peterborough to be precise peterborough against blackpool that game has just kicked off no goals in that one at the moment
in the anglo italian cup group a the other game being played in this country tonight as i was telling you a short while ago bolton nil UNK one the goal UNK after three
there is one other game taking place tonight in group a that game taking place in italy in and that's against UNK
that game kicking off seven fifteen local time that's italian time so eight fifteen over here
group b tonight west UNK against UNK and over in italy against southend and UNK against portsmouth
and just to remind you what i was saying if you've just switched on what i was just UNK with colin er earlier is that erm it's slightly different in this competition to what we've been UNK to in the football league er this and last season in as far as it's not goals scored that's important when you have the same number of points it is goal difference
so er for instance if bolton and notts county er at the end of their group matches both have seven points and both have scored eight goals but bolton have UNK two and notts county have UNK three then bolton will go through on goal difference
goals scored isn't that important
so it's basically if they finish on the level points goal difference shall determine the final positions followed by the highest number of goals scored and then by the highest number of goals scored away from home
this time next week of course colin and i will be in UNK andrew will be in this seat and we'll be bringing you full commentary on that game between notts and UNK
okay let me just remind you of that competition question we're running at the moment er the first of three video competitions we have this evening
it's a history of sport video entitled primitive UNK it's basically about erm physical contact in sport so it's er boxing it's UNK it's UNK that sort of thing
and the question relates to boxing
name the three current world UNK champions
there are of three of them at the moment after the weekend what are their names is the number to call
hi everybody out there i'm carl and you know what
you're listening to radio nottingham sport with martin
every morning just before seven o'clock i ring somebody up on radio nottingham and say get out of bed
and it's richard at radio nottingham and you're on the air at the moment this is your wake up call
oh you're UNK somebody's playing about here
then there's a little bit of friendly conversation
a chat
you must be joking at seven
o'clock in the morning
i'll just dose off here
yo
and you just talk away
are you not normally up at this time
and a chance to win a prize it's the kind of thing that anyone would love to be nominated for
what you gonna do to UNK now next time you see her
ring her neck
well we could get her back another day couldn't we
it's on radio nottingham's breakfast show everyday at six fifty five so send a nomination soon to in nottingham
and if anybody puts my name down they are in big trouble
radio nottingham sport special ten to eight no goals at the moment at lane between notts and pisa across to colin shortly
always a nice tune that one int it
lisa UNK and so natural
already at lane colin
a UNK shot by an UNK tony at twelve yards has put notts in front after eight minutes here against pisa
's headed er ball down just inside the penalty area on the right hand side was picked up by UNK past a defender used the ball well picked out the pisa defence wasn't in position was and a r really fierce shot into the roof of the net and didn't have a chance to save at all and had got the important early UNK
what's much more important for him is of course is that he's score got his name on the score sheet and tony will be such a relieved man and the UNK so delighted for him
and all that let me tell you after pisa looked so dangerous in the first eight minutes clearly they'd come out looking for the early goal themselves and who was badly UNK by in the early stages and needed attention he's the number eight and the number eleven who looks as quick as any player i've seen in ages and ages they are the two danger men and they will need some marking
but notts will settle down because they've made it one nil
and thank you tony
yes colin reporting
more from colin throughout the evening including some second half commentary for you
great start notts one pisa nil tony the goal UNK there after six minutes
just a reminder about other score tonight in group a of the anglo italian cup
bolton UNK nil UNK one the goal UNK there after three minutes
no goals as yet in the other game in group a against UNK although as i warned you earlier i don't think we'll have that score for you tonight because it is being played in italy and er our chances of getting that score through the er computer here are remote to put it UNK
in group b west UNK against UNK no goals as yet and two games in italy tonight in that group against southend and UNK against portsmouth
interesting score lines already in the coca cola cup third round UNK
we were telling you earlier that blackburn were one up over shrewsbury town mike the goal UNK after six well has UNK immediately for shrewsbury after twenty shrewsbury town one blackburn rovers one
that game got under way at er seven thirty so they're around about fifteen minutes away from half time
and peterborough one blackpool nil is the latest score the goal UNK there after three minutes
a reminder of that competition question for you a history of sport video to be won we're after the three world UNK champions
who are they
the three current world UNK champions is the number to call
on we go to the news with a bit of UNK
b c news in the east midlands at eight o'clock with mike
UNK have been served against the home secretary and his predecessor kenneth clarke for trying to UNK the legal guardian of six nottingham children who were UNK from leaving the country
has been looking after her younger brothers and sisters since they were made wards of court when their parents were sent back to india
jeremy reports
the family came to britain from UNK when their home was burnt down during UNK nine years ago
but after losing a UNK fight for asylum both parents were UNK
now their eldest daughter has been told to leave too but her supporters believe the decision is a clear breach of the children's UNK order
lawyers are expected to argue that michael howard and mr clarke are both in UNK of the UNK decision by pursuing 's UNK
her eldest brother says she should be allowed to stay
if they UNK our sister from us the family's gonna be dead actually cos there's gonna be nobody left here to look after them

b c east midlands news it's five past eight
this is radio nottingham sport with martin
five past eight and the latest score in the anglo italian cup notts county one pisa nil tony after six minutes back with colin shortly
one between peterborough and blackpool and one between shrewsbury and blackburn in the coca cola cup
electronic with getting away with it always reminds me a bit of the new order record that er came out in the nineteen ninety world cup period
similar sort of UNK work apparently or so they tell me
a approaching ten minutes after eight b c radio nottingham sport special with myself martin through until ten tonight
across to shortly for the UNK of the first half in the coca cola cup third round UNK shrewsbury one blackburn rovers one is the latest score
before that though another goal at the lane for colin
it's two nil to notts it's stuff here because tony scored and he hadn't scored previously this season when he UNK one in on eight minutes
and now would you believe it's the other notts player who hadn't scored this season has been desperate for a goal paul
you wouldn't call it the best UNK you ever seen and after a little bit of UNK play which pisa failed to get the ball away it fell inviting on the edge of the area and he struck it with all the confidence and UNK a player who's been planting 'em in the back of the net all season
he hasn't but on this occasion and for the second time with just over twenty minutes played the pisa goalkeeper was picking the ball out of the back of the net
pisa when they come forward don't be UNK are playing some very attractive football indeed
and there was one real chance of an UNK what was doing to miss the target completely with a header when he had only to beat
there were all sorts of arguments went on between and the central defender that's phil on loan from sheffield wednesday tonight with playing at left back and what was doing well maybe could explain to because i couldn't UNK it either myself
but he allowed get clear and almost made it one
has made it two nil
that's football isn't it
and er notts are pressing through again and er two down of course pisa are beginning to pull players back but on the break they are dangerous and here they come again
the flag stays down he's wide on the left hand side goes to close him down holds on he's on the edge of the area he shoots and the shot is charged down and then pushed behind no UNK it good work by sheer determination by the notts goalkeeper acting almost as an extra defender
got the ball away when it might've been a fourth pisa corner
yes they've had three of those notts have had only one but notts have scored the two goals
and the names on the score sheet don't rub your eyes in UNK when you see the morning paper they are and
and it's going pretty well down at lane so far colin our reporter down there
just to remind you er we'll be k taking regular reports from colin throughout the night plus a bit of second half commentary as well
the other group a game tonight bolton nil UNK one and that's good news from notts county's point of view
i'm sure most of you are aware of the er the way this er competition is sorted out
but basically although UNK and pisa are in the same league as notts county how they er fare in the competition doesn't really bother notts county er as apart from their games against notts
what i'm trying to say is that er notts county supporters have gotta watch out for the other english UNK scores rather than the italian UNK scores
notts county have got to finish top of the english section of group a
so the fact that bolton before tonight had got three points as too had notts is er indicative of the fact that notts need to win tonight and they could do with bolton losing
middlesbrough and UNK make up the group UNK tonight away to middlesbrough don't play this evening er no details as yet about how the game is going in italy and we don't expect to have any details either er because of the difficulties getting the score from italy
we can go to shrewsbury though because er that's much closer to home isn't it
shrewsbury against blackburn rovers third round UNK of the coca cola cup blackburn went ahead after six minutes through mike and UNK for shrewsbury on twenty
we can now go live to
john the former manchester city manager is there a former manager of shrewsbury as well he's with alan and blackburn have just gone close to going two one up
a great save at this time in the game they certainly don't wanna concede a goal now
with a corner
again right UNK hanging in the air heads it up and away
tries to head it back into the penalty area and it UNK off
forward by and again the clearance comes out and again clear is there
it's hit towards the halfway line alan the sole defender for blackburn at the moment he plays it to his right forward it goes to now that's a good ball down the far side of the field plenty of er men available 's one of them inside the penalty area the cross wasn't so good from and it's gonna run UNK behind for a goal kick
it's odd though to see david being so positive in the penalty area because he's only ever scored four league goals you know
he's never scored in the cup
he doesn't look the sort of player to me that would score many goals i have to say
but that was a good break great save by the goalkeeper
certainly has earned his few quid tonight about to take this goal kick we're inside the final minute of what has been a very good first half for the third division side one goal each
but could UNK the first half forward inside the p shrewsbury penalty area being forced to run wide though that was good play by
finds trying to make room for the cross he's tackled and tackled and it's only a goal kick
yes it's only a goal kick to shrewsbury town
still talking to the referee there's a lot of UNK going on out there and the referee can clamp down on that very easily by just reaching for his hip pocket
he hasn't done so yet
we're into time added on by
we've had a couple of UNK in the first half not the sort that will give us the nine minutes of added time we had at UNK on saturday but certainly a minute or two this evening
the lights come on
ha we're expecting a cup of tea
UNK shrewsbury try to play the ball forward runs after it but he knew it was a lost cause and the ball is through to bobby
hits his clearance to the halfway line controlled immediately by inside the centre circle he was UNK has to careful here and he isn't careful it's won back by now he's got to the right running into the penalty area could do with an early cross holds it up slips it back knocks it in to the middle now jumps doesn't make contact it's headed away by and good play now between and gets it back to 's clearance onto the head of good header on too to
still short of the halfway line now we've already played over a minute of added time in the first half and the referee oh i thought he was gonna blow for half time instead he's spotted something on the UNK of the field it's a free kick to blackburn
takes it but surely not from the right position
play allowed to continue forwards towards he's had a good game tonight if it's even if it's not his regular position he's been pushed there by and as a result it's a free kick to shrewsbury town
UNK very well there shrewsbury he was in a little big of trouble but tommy came away with the ball very well
with the free kick it's UNK inside his own half and blackburn as they as they do away from home they get everybody behind the ball even if they are from the third division
it's played UNK and headed away by but into UNK possession UNK good ball forward down the right UNK and it's knocked back by is the second chance now level with the edge of the penalty area 's available once more is tackled and the ball is out of play despite 's rather erm annoyed look it is a throw in to shrewsbury town and of course gets UNK but then he gets UNK everywhere
he's a player they like to dislike don't they
i don't think that'll bother him too much
no it doesn't he's a tough little character lovely lad too
throw in by into the penalty area heads it away jumps again but too late UNK his whistle does the referee keith and the applause tells you that they're happy at they should be it's one goal each
i think shrewsbury have done very well they UNK a goal very early on in the game and they could have gone to pieces but they gathered themselves together got back in the game with a goal from and they've done themselves proud so far
what they must not do is to get in there at half time and think that they have done their job
they've gotta get in there brush and wash themselves down and come in with renewed UNK and really have a go at blackburn in the second half
i mean john blackburn ha have kept the pace up so it will be quick for shrewsbury tonight
they
yeah
they are not UNK league players so they're gonna UNK as the evening goes on
yes
contingency can you make to er look after that
they will i a agree with that but the nice thing is that if they can get out there and get at 'em and get another goal that will build their confidence and their stamina and everything up and i thi really do think alan that they have a chance
early on within this game i th when blackburn scored i thought this game would be taken away from 'em
but credit to everybody concerned with the team they've dug in dug their UNK in come back well scored a goal and if they're confident now in themselves and go out there with that belief they can really do something here tonight
and presumably you'd like to see push a little bit further UNK
well i it always UNK me
it always it is always a thing that is i within football y you get a goal and then you get in behind the ball and think that you you're safe and you're alright
you're not you've gotta get people marked down and you gotta stop them from developing the play
and at times blackburn have been allowed to develop the play far too readily
well having seen blackburn rovers away from home a few times this season i i've gotta say at half time i thought they'd be UNK in control
they're not
alan and john our reporting team there at one UNK shrewsbury and blackburn back there for some second half commentary later on
last time we were at lane notts were leading by two goals to nil over pisa but the italians have got one back
colin
yes i pick up on the comment from the notts aren't as in control as they were after first tony and then paul got their names on the score sheet in each case for the first time this season both with UNK finishing efforts and you'd be a harsh UNK indeed who didn't agree that pisa deserved to pull one back because they played some fine attacking football and it was the player who's caused most danger who's wearing the number eleven that moved across to the right hand side got clear of the defence pulled back an absolutely brilliant UNK cross and in the middle who'd missed an earlier header on fifteen minutes to make it one didn't miss on this occasion
the notts defence pulled absolutely all over the place and it was the pace of coming up down that right hand UNK that did it
there's plenty of pace in this er pisa forward line and er they aren't finished this game isn't finished
i kept making the point on saturday here at lane martin that i didn't think that erm we'd had the last of the goals as they kept er popping in at both ends and i'm sure though we've had three with a little over half an hour played here we haven't seen the last of the goals here either
and i don't think we've seen the last from pisa at two one
notts er haven't got a sufficient advantage to feel that er this game is all over and done with
and the very player that i was talking about then turns up now down the left hand side he holds on so well the cross again and er again almost gets the cross in and our er colleague from the italian service is er getting very excited a just away to my left but er the header is wide he can calm down a little have an UNK and it's still two one for notts but er pisa they're a danger and to me they look far more dangerous than the italian UNK in the last game here at lane in this same competition
colin at lane
ah UNK there and UNK strikes b c radio nottingham sport special twenty three minutes after eight o'clock er let me just bring you up to date with the latest scores up and down the country
in the coca cola cup third round UNK as we were hearing a short while ago from third division shrewsbury town one blackburn rovers one for rovers after six the UNK on twenty
peterborough now two one up over blackpool in the other UNK peterborough going ahead after three minutes through a own goal making it one after fourteen has just given peterborough a two goal advantage
in the anglo italian cup group a notts county two pisa one on eight paul on twenty getting a goal back for pisa on thirty er approaching half time six minutes to go before half time across there with colin for that half time report as soon as the whistle goes
and the other game in group a bolton have pulled a goal back against UNK it's now one UNK for UNK after three and with the UNK on thirty nine
in group b one game taking place tonight in england west UNK two UNK one on sixteen and an own goal by after twenty eight but on twenty nine has pulled a goal back for UNK it's two one
and now in the er UNK games this evening these are the latest scores UNK nil UNK two UNK nil carlisle one david on target there after forty bury one stockport two cambridge against UNK cardiff against UNK exeter against plymouth all UNK hull nil scarborough two UNK one UNK one UNK against UNK still awaiting the first goals there UNK nil UNK one and york city one UNK nil
the all important game as far as we're concerned in this area is taking place at UNK tonight it's UNK against lincoln city er that's the group in which er mansfield town have been competing and er well it's pretty complicated in this competition too
basically you get three points if you win a game one point if you get a draw no points if you lose
now so far mansfield have played two games
they lost to lincoln one nil and then they beat UNK three one
so the table going into tonight's game mansfield on top with three points from two games lincoln three points from one and UNK no points from one game
now the way it's sorted out in this competition is that er it's points first if two teams are level on points then it's the number of goals scored then it's goal difference and if they're all level after that then it's drawing lots and the top team in the group have a home game in round two and the team that finishes runners up are away in round two
is that all pretty simple for you
mm i hope so
so basically if lincoln draw tonight then they'll finish top and mansfield will be second if er lincoln win they'll be top and mansfield will be second
if UNK win then we're in into the UNK of er the old calculator er because if they win all teams will have three points
it th will then be down to goals scored
at the moment lincoln have
did you know there's someone waiting for you at radio nottingham's reception UNK bear is sitting there waiting for you to take him home

now then er regular listeners will know that over the last couple of years or so we've done some special UNK trips for you er and we've gone down to london
we've been to lords and we've also been to UNK we've been to UNK and we've also been to UNK
well next spring in may of next year we're looking to put a trip together to go to the UNK of the country to old UNK obviously er manchester UNK home ground also to UNK and also to a couple of er other places that aren't sort of UNK but i'm sure will interest you
UNK t v UNK in manchester and also the UNK centre in liverpool
at the moment we're er just sorting out the price of things we think it will be available at around about ninety nine pounds and that will include your travel there your hotel accommodation and i've got the leaflet of the hotel in front of me and it looks pretty spectacular actually
it's called the hotel leisure and conference centre it's actually based at UNK or UNK if you come from that neck of the woods and er everybody that goes will be able to use the UNK swimming pool er or challenge someone to a game of squash on one of our six courts
you could also work out in our fully equipped UNK so it sounds pretty UNK doesn't it
erm we're just in the UNK at the moment of putting things together there er so if you are interested then erm keep listening and we'll give you some more details on that er potential trip in the forthcoming weeks
it sounds pretty good and it would be around about may the twenty first twenty second so it would be after the football season has finished er so we'd have a tour of old UNK the manchester united football ground behind the scenes go to the special museum there see all of their UNK do something similar at UNK the following morning and in the afternoon on the saturday go to UNK t v UNK and er on the sunday we'll be going er around liverpool and their various er little places of UNK around the er the UNK
that's er all to come in may
twenty three minutes no it's not twenty three martin you're not reading the clock correctly it's twenty six and a half minutes away from nine o'clock they're still playing down at lane so they're getting er enough time down there to er get stuck into er all the injury time
two one notts county lead tony after six paul after twenty pisa getting a goal back through after thirty minutes
we'll be across to colin as soon as the half time whistle goes
just a reminder of that er quiz competition we have for you at the moment we're giving away a UNK video and the quiz question for you is about motorbike riders and we want you identify the UNK of these three riders please michael is rider a UNK is rider b and is rider c
so give us a call come on the line tell chris and kieran that it's er the UNK competition you're coming in for and then say rider a michael is from where rider b UNK is from where and rider c is from there
and you may well win yourself that UNK video
i cannot believe the amount of injury time actually you see if i put a record on at half past eight they'll have finished bang on half past eight but er the fact that i carry on UNK and telling you about the quiz competition three or four times er they decide to play plenty of injury time
but the half time whistle has gone four minutes late but it's gone
colin
just gone we're obviously working to italian time in this italian job because we've had really five minutes of UNK time at the end of the first half and i'm a bit UNK as to why we had it
i'm also UNK about the first half in more respect than one
UNK by some of the UNK decisions but that's a minor thing compared to the fact that notts were two goals ahead with just about minutes played and then went completely off the boil they had pisa on the run they failed to UNK on it and pisa have finished the stronger of the two sides towards the end of the first half
and only two amazing UNK one of those UNK coming er just before scored the second notts goal with a headed chance headed wide when er had come and missed it and when on forty four minutes on the watch but not a minute before the end of half time if you get the meaning because we had that long period of extra time er missed the chance completely he'd made the er pisa goal brilliantly with a cross from the right hand side deep cross pulled back brilliantly but left with a chance the number eleven in front of the post well what was he doing again had come and again he'd missed it and left with an open goal was wide of the target
well notts went wide of the target on eight minutes it was er all really set up by gary with a little header down to paul inside right channel UNK it on to the defence was wide open and who hadn't scored this season got the very goal that he's been wanting to score to add to his match winning performance on saturday when he was made the UNK player of the match and er he UNK the ball in the net it was quite a UNK effort and notts should've settled down on that and certainly should've settled down on twenty one
it was an UNK sort of UNK but the ball fell UNK for on the edge of the area and who hasn't been scoring at all this season finished with all the UNK of a player who's full of confidence
hasn't been he's been even more desperate than to get a goal but he got one on twenty one
in between time as i say we'd had 's header wide which was one of the UNK of the first half
and then on thirty two minutes pisa got a goal which quite frankly they deserved and it was a brilliant effort it was probably the best goal of the three
made it down the right hand side he's wearing number eleven but he came down the right hand side on this occasion and er a deep cross he pulled it back brilliantly and who'd missed that earlier header was there and couldn't really miss on this occasion but it was a fine header by him
not the cover on him there might have been the sort of er chance clear chance that was given say to in the local derby match the other saturday and really made it count
pisa have some fine individual players the number ten er finished the first half having er had attention UNK rather badly and er pisa have all their UNK who've remained out and are UNK up
it'll be int UNK to see whether or not they're gonna make some changes in the second half
i'll make the point again martin that just as on saturday when goals were flying in at both ends and eventually it finished three two i kept saying don't believe the scoring is all over in this game that's my feeling now
but although it's two one to notts the scoring is a long way from over and pisa two one down are a long way from being finished with
okay colin
colin at lane for us
notts county against pisa two one at half time we'll be bringing you er commentary in the second half sharing the commentary with the match at between shrewsbury town and blackburn rovers it's a third round UNK in the coca cola cup blackburn went ahead on six minutes through mike UNK on twenty and a short while ago shrewsbury taking the lead a penalty put away with some UNK by they lead two one
so let's go across to now our commentary team alan er john the former manchester city and former shrewsbury town manager and also there is er rob and we've got more excitement
and it's tommy who's scored the young UNK has done so well at the heart of the defence for shrewsbury has got into the opposition penalty area and what about this for a score line
multi million pound blackburn rovers are UNK this side UNK built by fred for shrewsbury it's shrewsbury three blackburn rovers one
there've been some big by shrewsbury over the years i'll tell ya there've been some big clubs here in the past years and it looks very much on the cards again tonight they have got a massive job on their hands now blackburn to come back into this
blackburn rovers are being run absolutely UNK here
eleven minutes of the second half gone shrewsbury town three blackburn rovers one kevin steve with a penalty and tommy the young UNK doing so well tonight here to get those goals for shrewsbury we're going off to neil
yes UNK certainly look like they're back from the UNK coming forward at every opportunity and it paid off with john he ball steven couldn't clear and brian well and UNK in control aberdeen nil UNK one
who'd have thought that shrewsbury would be in control here but with twelve minutes of the second half gone they are
and blackburn are desperately fighting for their lives in this league cup competition
they have the ball out with stewart on this right hand side so much needed of him tonight he gets that one across it falls to and gets the shot in and makes the save
shrewsbury stood around there apparently looking for the offside and in the end it was an awful effort at goal
yeah they got away with murder there that looked very UNK whether it was offside the UNK didn't give it the really should have scored
but now could move them forward again down this right hand side he holds it up fifteen yards inside the shrewsbury half turns it in fields short to david now takes over UNK it up towards the penalty area headed down by good break for
oh
he's gone down he's looking for a penalty and it's been given the referee consulted the UNK he looked at his UNK it was who went in or was it chris on david the penalty award has been given by the referee he looked to confirm it with the UNK on the UNK and that confirmation was all that he had needed to point to the spot
so blackburn rovers now do have an opportunity to put themselves back in with a shout in this tie
it's mike who's scored three goals scored four goals already this season
steps up and right UNK he UNK it into the bottom corner it UNK the shrewsbury crowd somewhat blackburn fans are UNK because at last there's some light for them but they're still UNK shrewsbury by three goals to two
two rash UNK one at the other end by mike and now one at this end in the shrewsbury with it was certainly shrewsbury penalty UNK erm penalty was won UNK was as well
so how important tommy goal could prove
but shrewsbury are after more they're looking to set away now and that one has been pushed away by colin
now here takes over under pressure he is from chris back inside his own half taking over is UNK that one forward towards graham he's trying to hook it out to on this right hand side and that one goes well beyond david and out for a throw in
i think if shrewsbury can hold on now for the next five or six or seven minutes they could be alright
if they concede another goal again now i think they could be in serious trouble again
it's very unfortunate
i must say
we are at the at where shrewsbury town of the third division lead UNK blackburn by three goals to two but blackburn now moving forward getting it across it breaks back to drives it in low and left UNK and that one is off the target a shot driven in from twenty five yards by not finding the goal
that's not un that's not like at all is it
that was a great left UNK shot and could have got a nasty UNK it's luckily for shrewsbury it went straight through everybody and er over for a goal kick
yes alan was mentioning in the first half poor strike rate just four goals in over two hundred and fifty UNK in his time at leeds united
but now blackburn moving forward looking for has gone four minutes late
that was a great cross by did UNK did absolutely magnificent he controlled the ball he turned left UNK shot in and hit against the post very unfortunate fo for blackburn but then i suppose shrewsbury deserve a little bit of luck
so much happening here at the moment as the ball was followed up by david he looked at the referee as er challenge him for the er shove inside the penalty area but the referee was UNK by that blackburn have already got one penalty here tonight from which they've scored shrewsbury have scored from a penalty too and it's the third division side still in the lead here by three goals to two
who would have thought it
here is now left edge of the penalty area moving towards the UNK and doing well there to take it away from him but at the expense of a throw in that's taken back to alan is twenty yards back from the UNK and moving back out towards the UNK on the far side
looks for the support of graham and finds it
gets past but he can't get past and shrewsbury are breaking with it but they're still inside their own half at the moment with kevin who gave them the fighting chance with the original UNK inside the first half
is under pressure again now and loses out to kevin
