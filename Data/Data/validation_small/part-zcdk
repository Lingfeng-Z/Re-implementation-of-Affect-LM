UNK their own way and depending on the stresses within the group the members will almost UNK sort out a set of relationships which will provide both behaviour patterns and thereby establish a balance of power
UNK occurs when the struggle for power between potential task centred actors is no longer an issue the task itself is the issue
UNK of the task and maintenance UNK find a level of equilibrium in which case the performing stage of group evolution has been reached
UNK the member providing the task centred behaviour leaves the group e g to go on holiday then the group members will UNK and the behaviour patterns will be UNK
UNK time taken for this balancing of UNK and influence will depend on the group members on their perceptions and expectations on the task and on the internal stresses
UNK a work group a new structure will emerge within one or two weeks
UNK the original task centred actor returns he or she will probably try to get the role back and another week or two will have to pass before the group UNK equilibrium again
UNK has taken the analysis of group roles further and argues that up to nine roles can be identified in a work group
UNK combinations of these roles have been found to be more effective for certain tasks than others
UNK me list his categories
UNK s description of team roles has proved to be very useful especially in creating teams for specific purposes
UNK example the composition of a design team will be different from the team created to implement that design
UNK only reservation with his classification of roles is that it reflects a UNK with task UNK
UNK cultures there is an equal interest in the process the role of the maintenance leaders
UNK the chief executive is UNK and dominant in managerial style then the UNK will move the group into balance by adopting less dominant more consensus seeking maintenance oriented behaviour patterns
